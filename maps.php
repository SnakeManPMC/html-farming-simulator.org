	<h2>HOWTO Test New Maps / Terrains</h2>

<p>In order to enjoyable play in a map you need to test that there are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Crops. Well doh obviously!</li>
	<li>Farm has room to maneuvre. Too "quake l3v3l!!1", claustrophobic farm object placement is horror. I don't necessarily mean you have to have space for dozen Big Bud 747's, but if you cant drive your harvester there, then whats the point?</li>
	<li>Grain silos. Some place for you to store your grain in the farm, so you dont have to sell it right away</li>
	<li>Grain selling points. Well quite obvious but still</li>
	<li>Roads are not too narrow. Yes, we all love BIG BUD <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"></li>
	<li>Fences and gates arent restricting movement to prevent good gameplay</li>
	<li>Animals; chickens, pigs, cows and sheep</li>
	<li>Water. Animal caretaking</li>
	<li>Grass for animals, yes you can sow grass but there should some a lot of it by default</li>
	<li>Forestry. At least little bit</li>
	<li>Train. Not necessary but very big bonus</li>
	<li>Shop with yard where you dont run out of space when purchasing many vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>Every single field is surrounded with fences that are <b>tightly</b> right next to the fields edge AND the fences have gates which you must open, gates where you cant drive Big Bud tractor through <img src="images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Trees are also one type, oriented the same way.
</p>

<p>Starting equipment lineup makes no sense, huge fleet of harvesters but no trailers to ferry the harvest and no plough, seeder, etc. Heh, hilarious. Of course players are free to sell this useless lineup and purchase their own, but anyone who wants to play this map as its developer intended is out of luck.
</p>

<p>Railroad tracks that block access with harvester with header on tow (gets stuck) as are other vehicles too. The main farm or industrial area is like a prison, fences everywhere.

<p>
v1.0.2 by Kastor_Ger. From modDesc: CornBelt. Willkommen im CornBelt.
</p>

<p>Total of 65 fields. Has desert, sandy brown overall look near your farm, green else where. Map-view looks like it has no roads, cant tell how to drive from one place to another. Your farm is pretty nice and detailed, but has that brown dried up coloring on the ground. Field 35 (and who knows how many others) dont register to courseplay, you have to calculate the field edge yourself first.
</p>

<p>A lot of fields in the sense that there is not much of wasted space, its all fields one next to another. Kind of a nice highway system. Huge bridge over very deep river canyon, although looks bit silly as the river is then like -1m deep heh. Few trees are dangerously close to the highway so driving along with Big Bud with Seed Hawk in tow... you need to drive in the middle of the highway for not to get stuck.
</p>

<p>Overall pretty decent looking map, takes huge amount of time to get familiar because its so packed with fields and very large 8km map size.
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-01 updated review</b>
</p>

<p>
F35 has powerline poles in the middle of the field... however the terrain dev was smart enough to disable geometry on those so you can drive just straight through them. Not perhaps the most realistic option, but at least it prevents player frustration which I think its ultimately the better choice.
</p>

<p>
Roads are not painted into the mapview, this makes navigating this huge terrain very difficult. There is also slight issue of many fields being so close together that because of 8km terrain size and the image resolutions, the engine will draw the field status (growth, fertilization etc) without any border to the next field which is no fault of the terrain dev, just the nature of 8km terrains in FS17 engine (well okay he could have left more empty room between fields).
</p>

<p>
Highways have some invisible barrier you cannot across, this makes highways frustrating as you have to go around half the terrain just to drive one grain or whatever delivery loop. See also <a href="https://youtu.be/FbXJSnlfoRA?t=2195" target="_blank">Rudeman53 Gaming comments</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this terrain is one of those glow in the dark ones, you can see clearly at the middle of the night, even when its cloudy. Sunrise is after 0430hrs, it starts to get light already at that time.
</p>

<p>
Mapview falsely shows you many gas stations... which are not traditional gas stations where you could refuel your vehicle, they are instead some modded crude OIL drop off points or something. Very frustrating if you are trying to find the next closest gas station to top of your running on fumes vehicle.
</p>

<p>
<del>Train oil tanker cars</del> some objects in the train yard are huge performance killers, FPS goes from 60 to 25.
</p>

<p>
Field 30 has some objects floating above it, looks ugly but does not cause game play issues. Field 17 has railroad tracks running across it, that is really odd which prevents you from proper field work.
</p>

<p>
On my "from scratch" savegame where I didn't own field 35, I got some bug in field 34 southern and f33 eastern edges as implements say "you dont own this field", you cant seed or harvest right from that edge. This will be fixed when you purchase field 35. This might not be an issue on original savegame files, but I would still consider it a bug. I'm thinking it must be too large field definition on F35 or something.
</p>

<p>
Same you dont own this field problem in field 35 south edge when field 32 has not been purchased (this is on stock default cornbelt files and savegame).
</p>

<p>
Field 37 will freeze courseplay if you try to calculate field edge, not sure whats wrong with that field. Or maybe I just didnt wait enough, I spent like probably 5min waiting and then killed FS17 from task manager.
</p>

<p>
Field 46 has been cut off by fence on purpose so that player has to go around the way terrain dev intended (same as the invisible barrier on the highways). Also the only road leading to this field is very curvy and bumpy, I bet courseplay driving trailer truck will get stuck or roll over.
</p>

<p>
Some of the fields are not setup properly for missions, you start a mission but it places you well outside the field area so the mission will fail. Few of these fields I checked and found are 62 and 9.
</p>

<p>
Overall Cornbelt is my favorite terrain at 2018-10-04 which is kind of funny how this one slipped under my radar even though I did check it out last year. This terrain is so huge as its 8km in size that you really have to play a lot in it to appreciate everything it has to offer, its not until you harvest one of those 50+ hectare fields and drive back and forth across the terrain that you start to realize how cool this terrain is. The more I played this the more I appreciated how excellent terrain this is, you just want to play and cant stop <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>Just one insane large corn field with your farm (so to speak) in the middle of it with BGA and some stuff. Yes this is 8km map but unless you are some corn megalomaniac... this is not a normal terrain heh. All respect for making 8km terrain, of course, but just hoping there was at least few other fields available (not to mention animals etc).

<p>Total of 126 fields registered (courseplay finds). View of the map looks very busy. Has airport. Feels like a huge place with many interesting locations. Some of the fields are bit off, like corn across a road etc. Overall though its a bit rough map and would need just a little bit of fine tweaking.
</p>

<p>Has a highway which connects across the map nicely for quick travel, few bridges look a bit tight not sure if Big Bud with Seed Hawk can pass through.

<h2>North West Texas</h2>

<a href="images/Map-North-West-Texas.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-North-West-Texas.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - North West Texas" loading="lazy" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>North West Texas by Txzar
</p>

<p>Looks pretty low res or rather quality when compared to official Goldcrest Valley terrain. But... I rather take low res large map than pixel porno tiny map <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Does not have grain silo marked on the map, but its there so you have to find it. There are three silos and they hold incredible amount of crops, one time I managed to dump 700,000 liters there so not sure what the limit per silo is (and you have three of them).
</p>

<p>Your farm is not properly lighted at night, very difficult to navigate on some parts. Nights sometime get pitch black, you cannot see a thing. This depends on the weather or clouds or something, sometimes you get like a moonlight scene and can see just fine for night environment.
</p>

<p>Some trees have white flickering parts which move when you move, odd.
</p>

<p>Lighting of sun comes from opposite direction. Looks odd though that sun is rising and shadows cast towards it heh.
</p>

<p>Field 28 has fence around it which also has very narrow gate, so no way to drive large harvester through it, even semi truck has problems with higher speed. Field 34 has only route to it blocked by narrow fence entry which wont allow harvester to pass, well unless you drive it manually.
</p>

<p>Fields 33 - 35 are cut off from wide vehicle traffic. No way to get wide harvester there because of only one narrow fence entry. Also semi truck trailer geometry clips on the railroad tracks which are just beyond the fence entry.
</p>

<p>Tree planting (pallet saplings) with Damcon PL-75 does not work.
</p>

<h2>North West Texas Revisited Beta</h2>

<p>North West Texas Revisited Beta by Txzar
</p>

<p><b>2018-07-06 this map is v0.9.2.1</b> and only available to download from "pinned post" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/txzarmapping/" target="_blank">txzarmapping</a> page.
</p>

<p>Looks very much changed from the old version, I didnt recognize the old farm anymore, many more silos which use I'm not sure of (store grain? seeds? something?). Most fields were gone, they were grass now. I read Txzar saying that this is so players can plough the fields to their liking.
</p>

<p>This map has low and high view distance versions for your to choose (downloads), the higher version requires more powerful hardware.
</p>

<p>Sorghum and cotton crop types. Cotton is harvested with corn header.
</p>

<p>Animated train (not the one that players can use). Railroad tracks run across the map in south from east to west direction. When train goes off the map it stays there quite while which is nice because if would be too much activity if it would loop back immediately. This train has geometry so you have to be really careful with courseplay routes when acrossing the railroad tracks not to collide with the train and have your vehicles go rolling around.
</p>

<p>Large silos were added in the open gravel area next to field 5.
</p>

<p>New fences were added around some of the fields, which I assume was made to match the blue lines in the PDA map image what I read Txzar saying being property lines.

<h2>Newlin</h2>

<p>Newlin by Txzar
</p>

<p><b>2018-07-06 this map is v1.0</b> and only available to download from "pinned post" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/txzarmapping/" target="_blank">txzarmapping</a> page.
</p>

<p>Next terrain from Txzar the maker of North West Texas.
</p>

<p>This map has low and high view distance versions for your to choose (downloads), the higher version requires more powerful hardware.
</p>

<p>Skybox is animated meaning clouds move, well kind of, its the whole sky with everything thats moving. It is really fast too, very unrealistic looking.
</p>

<p>Looks like <b>almost every field is blocked by fence and narrow gate</b>, this is devastating effect for enjoyable game-play as you cannot use large equipment and even small equipment gets stuck very easily :-(
</p>

<p>Field 17 is covered with fences. And because of the field shape and the fences, courseplay overloader just wont work. Field 17 has trees so close to the headland that harvester with its pipe out will get stuck.
</p>

<p>Field 9 and 28 gate (same as any other?) is this standard model used on many maps, it barely and I mean just barely fits Big Bud through and you will get stuck if you are not really careful.
</p>

<p>Field 32 has narrow gate and powerline pole right next to the gate.
</p>

<p>Very nice digital elevation map (DEM) heightmap source was used, there are bumps and nudges everywhere and it looks very realistic.
</p>

<p>Field 15 is so tiny and it has fence literally touching the crop so a harvester with 45ft header cant really work on it using courseplay, you have to drive it manually. When sowing with great plains 18.2m seeder it can barely fit on the southern edges, the field is so tiny.
</p>

<p>Field 16 has telephone pole right next to the field in the south end, courseplay needs headland to avoid this.
</p>

<p>Field 19 is 3.25 hectares, grass and has about dozen trees in it so if you purchase this one it requires some logging work and grass mowing (or just plow directly) before any normal harvest can be done. None of the tree types were supported by ponsse scorpion king of logging, but you could cut them down with a chainsaw.
</p>

<p>Field 20 is 1.65 hectares, same as field 19. These two fields are separated by nothing more than barbed wire fence.
</p>

<p>Nights are like glow in the dark, when north west texas was pitch black dark in cloudy nights newlin is like a light would shine from the sky and light up the place, it looks weird. Skybox at night the stars move in the sky the same speed as clouds in the daytime.
</p>

<p>Sunrise 0600hrs. Sunset about 2100hrs. It starts to get dark at 1800hrs and it will take two hours at least to darken fully. Nights are as said "glow in the dark" at least in clear weather so you can see pretty easily at night time, its just "a bit dark" thats all. at 0500hrs completely dark, 0508hrs started to notice some fog type shading on the trees in the horizon. 0535hrs sky completely dark but horizon objects start to become increasingly "foggy" or hazed and that morning dew or whatever flying leafs etc is present. 0547hrs sky completely dark. at 0554hrs started to see slight shading on the sky.
</p>

<p>Pigs and sheeps water trought is inside the fenced area and especially with pigs you have to reverse your tractor there.
</p>

<p>Sorghum, cotton and feed corn crop types. Cotton is harvested with corn header.
</p>

<p>Animated train (not the one that players can use) on south west corner of the map running diagonally. You can see the train beyond map edge when it turns around, actually flips around. The train passes through way too often, its like constant train traffic which will get really old when you play more than couple of hours and see the train go back and forth for like a thousand times heh.
</p>

<p>Train has no collision so there is no issue with your courseplay etc driven vehicles. Traffic is quite nasty, as always, but it can be turned off from options so its not a big deal.
</p>

<p>Your farm grain silo is located about middle of the map, between fields 12, 32, 9 and 28. Sale points are marked on the map as usual.
</p>

<p>You can cut trees (tested few types in one of the big fields) and then plough some nice big fields, but also if you cut too many trees it takes away from the beauty of this map as well so be mindful of that.
</p>

<p>Wheat is some new textures and maybe even model, it looks completely different what the stock game wheat, its very bright almost blinding bright color. Also it has really bad shimmering effect when its been harvested.
</p>

<p>The dust effect is some odd white colored one. The ground dirt in general is not red but kind of reddish, unlike the dark brown as in stock game, no idea if texas ground dirt has such color shading but it kind of looks odd, reminds me of red dirt of vietnam heh.
</p>

<p>Courseplay wont work in field 24, it just refuses to generate a course until you recalculated the field edge path from drive menu, this happens with some other fields as well.
</p>

<p>Field 24 purchase point has access way to the field... except its so narrow you cannot properly fit big bud through and doubt smaller tractors with implements do any better. However you can pass freely to this field from the NW corner, its wide open there.
</p>

<p>Field 14 has fence all around it and you have to go through F13 fence gate to get here.
</p>

<p>Field 21 courseplay hits the fence near that electric box with a small road and a tree. And on the other side of that spot is a telephone pole where harvester gets stuck.
</p>

<p>Fields that are not defined in giants editor properly, will simply not work. The fields will not register in the game even after you plough it using "allow create fields" option. So fields 1 - 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 25 just wont never work.
</p>

<p>Also field 41 is the last one you can access in NE, big bud cannot pass the gate between fields 41 and 38 rendering 38, 39, 40 and 42 out of reach as there is no other way to get them.
</p>

<p>Overall Newlin is very bad with the fences, gates and trees so close to the fields, this is causing issues for courseplay use. Simply said, most fields are bad at best with courseplay, some just dont work at all like field 17 for example.

<p>Looks OK but still has bit maze alike farm, very narrow roads with geometry blocks on the side so forget Big Bud. Looks like almost all roads have fences. North east edge has some rocky mountain side with "level" stuff.
</p>
</div>

<div class="terrain4km">
<h2>Greatfields</h2>

<p>Insane 600ha field haha! On quick glance looks great. Huge mountrain edge "skybox" backdrop texture planes, looks massive. Large hillside on S-SW part. Extremely large forestry logging area in NW corner.
</p>

<p>However this is same as pleasant valley that it uses goldcrest valley as copy pasted base and the map has just been extended around it. Greatfields is not goldcrest copy though, it only has small areas that are directly from it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="terrain4km">
<h2>Saxonia</h2>

<p>Train tracks. Very nice map which includes large fields and level terrain. Airbase is also included where Tornado jets are taking off and landing, very cool.

<p>A bit more narrower roads again, seems to have no missions. Extremely mild rolling hills theme going on. Some forest spots. Few odd fields with some sort of bush type trees there.
</p>
</div>

<div class="terrain4km">
<h2>Germantown</h2>

<p>Incredible 148 fields. Small rolling hills theme going on. A lot of forestry logging trees around. Train tracks. Some rocky small hills (very small spots). Very nice looking european terrain.
</p>
</div>

<div class="terrain4km">
<h2>Pleasant Valley v17</h2>

<p>Original goldcrest valley is on the center, but now its enlargened from 2048 (2km) into 4km map size. Many things have been added to the extra terrain space, looks nice. However it has quite hefty required mods list.
</p>
</div>

<p>Have huge train tracks. Aircrafts, helicopters and blimps flying around (not really sure if that is cool as there are so many of them). Animated horses. Moving trains. Flicker on some of the skybox like "side panel" textures. Map feels little bit too "busy" if you know what I mean.

<p>Map edges are covered with rocky mountain barrier. Total of 72 fields. Dirt and paved roads. Quite bit of forestry logging. Very nice open areas for Big Bud usage, not sure about some of the bridge choke points though. Overall flat terrain elevations. This is a good looking map.

<h2>Monchwinkel - Landkreis Oder-Spree</h2>

<p>Total of 91 fields. Many trees around the fields and some forests areas too, seems to have more of those "round" non-pine trees which name I don't know. Train tracks for players and animated trains in N edge and NW corner. Edges of the map has nice buffer area of sparse round trees. Feels very much like european germany terrain. This is nice looking map, perhaps more looking like a ArmA 3 terrain than FS17 farming map.
</p>

<p>On the edges there are a lot of tree texture planes and behind them some low poly tree objects (I believe these are large forest blocks) to take up perfectly good space, some of the planes you can pass through, others can't. Especially in NW corner there is huge area of these low poly tree objects. Seems to me like otherwise perfectly fine looking 4km map was populated with these poor looking low poly tree objects.

<p>Huge fields, definitely Big Bud country heh. Field 19 has incredible expandability. SW corner has insanely large forestry logging area. Quite flat terrain. Skybox ends too soon in SE and NW corners. This looks like very nice map indeed.

<p>Moderately flat terrain, small bumbs here and there. Large forest logging area west central and north edges. Large fields and open areas, feels like a Big Bud country. This is very nice basic map indeed.

<p>Nice "skybox" background after map edges. Edges have nice set of forest trees, many tree types and placed randomly which looks very natural. Large forestry logging area in NW corner. Little bit symmetrical map, train tracks and those concrete areas in the edges, not too bad though. Tiny amount of rolling hills mood on the fields (as name should suggest, hills). Few rocky spots with trees between the fields. This map definitely has a lot of trees to cut down if thats your choice. This is good looking map for sure.

<p>Small edge rocky mountain blocks but that is not too bad. Some forestry logging area in S-SW. Train tracks. Large forest area in N at some odd elevated terrain level. Very wild terrain in N-NE corner. Terrain elevations for rest of the areas is very smooth, only minor changes, looks good. This is overall good looking map if we forget the odd rocky corner area.

<p>Interesting name, not sure if that MadeInGermany should somehow be in the name, I bet this maps real name is just Celle, which is location in germany. Not very good off the map well texture I guess, transparent and looking bad. Large amount of 121 fields. Map made out of satellite imagery so it looks great, realistic map. Huge forestry logging area in SE, NE corners and trees cover most of the map edges and field edges. Great looking realistic map overall.

<p>
v1.4.2 by ChillyUK Modding (StrawChewer). From modDesc: Parkers Prairie. Parkers Prairie.USA.
</p>

<p>Very nice large farm, lots of room to drive vehicles. Map edges are not usual rocky mountain block, but some grassy low hill. Bunch of trees around the edges and fields (trees are placed with variations and random rotation) which is nice. Train tracks which are not animated and don't appear to contain player drivable locomotive either. Readme stated that one of the fields (you own) is 114 hectares. This is very good looking map.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately Parkers Prairie v1.4.2 still has the pig straw location trigger graphic missing, you have to know where the straw drop-off point is. It is located next to the fence just right of the gate. You just have to use telehandler and slowly drive back and forth with straw bale close to the ground to see where it disappears (or you could use the development mode and F5 to check the trigger location).
</p>

<p>Night time in Parkers Prairie is fine, the light levels of the night change according to weather / clouds, sometimes its very dark and most of the time there is enough ambient light that you see to drive vehicles around larger obstacles etc. Very enjoyable night time.
</p>

<p>Skybox is really tight around the terrain area meaning you can see the map edges easily, not a showstopper but still.

<p>2018-07-15 Parkers Prairie is my go to map. I initially played goldcrest valley obviously to learn how to play, then I spent over 400 hours in North West Texas and now I have around 100 hours in Parkers Prairie. I really like this terrain, there is nothing that annoys me greatly or that would prevent me from playing. Highly recommended map :-)

<p>All but N side of the map blocked out by odd rocky mountains and most of the S side as you can see from the ugly german cowboys big-fat-cow logo. Also rocky mountains at the center of map too. Anyways there are lot of forestry logging possibilities for those who are interested in this map.

<p>Square fields which is always easier for stuff like courseplay. Animals require special foods like sheeps need something called lucerne and cows need something called proteinSilage.

This was terrain under private testing and then leaked to the public, also according to <a href="https://www.modland.net/farming-simulator-2017-mods/maps/lincoln-creek-map.html" target="_blank">nasty modland.net comments</a> this project has been abandoned or just never finished (speculation, also I found no official release of this).

</p>

<p>Version numbers are not listed because these maps often times get updated very frequently, so listing a version number is kind of outdated very easily. Also as the FS17 mod download sites are such a garbage its sometimes difficult to find latest version of released mod when the mod description is only a changelog.

<p>Pre placed sheep models. Custom fruits. Artificial barrier on the map edges, not even close to the real end of the map but like 200 coordinates earlier, so 2km map has been made intentionally smaller. Its OK looking I guess.

<p>What an creative name, hoh. This is actual island with water around it even though you cannot see it from the map overview. Large forestry area in NW.

<p>Texas Lone Star, nice Texas flag to keep the spirits up. Many trees so great logging forestry possibilities. Lakes with ducks and fishes is a nice touch. Only 17 fields but they are quite large. Very nice looking map.

<p>Very large fields, field 6 is 47 hectares. Map is surrounded by water but it doesn't feel like island, there is artificial edge where the water starts but that is almost on the real map coordinate edge already so its not that limiting factor.
</p>
</div>

<p>Field 2 is 50 hectares. Horrible looking rows of trees as they are copy pasted without any rotation variation so they look so bad. Also train tracks are very symmertical.

<p>Umm what? Looking at the map overview... err do I need to say more? <img src="images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"> Anyways the tiny map area is surrounded by rocky mountains which block you from moving further out.

<p>Oh wow another one with tiny area for map, why not just create full 1km map instead? Otherwise it looks OK, lots of trees and basic map in the tiny area surrounded by rocky mountain block.

<p>Very flat terrain, no hills, which is totally OK. Nice looking map. Feels eerily like "Alberta Canada, Alberta_Farms" map but maybe its just me.
</p>
</div>

<div class="terrain2km">
<h2>Turfway</h2>

<p>Uses the default goldcrest valley starter area, but only few buildings or small area. Surrounded by rocky mountains, also bit rocky on the basic areas. No real roads, only dirt paths in otherwise grass area. Two train tracks. Probably usable map for Big Bud DLC.
</p>

<p>Oh man one of these tiny maps again... and super claustrophobic farm where you can barely walk out without getting stuck to some geometry blocks. Sigh. Why not make this as 0.5km map haha. What is this, farm sim or pac-man hehe.

<p>Dry brownish desert looking map. Only five fields but largest of them are 104 and 80 hectares. Interesting map, might be some work in those large fields for Big Bud. BTW I heard from somewhere that this a large map, it is not, this is default 2km map.

<p>Not the absolutely tiniest map, but yeah its right up there. Looks like it has large forest area on the edges but its fake, only small rows of trees and rest is "skybox" texture planes. There is only one field which is registered by the game and its far off the tiny map area, its located on the NW corner and looks like its kind of bugged or maybe even forgotten there. I believe this map is very heavily work in progress or just, really odd heh.

<p>Kind of sandy colored brown, dryish map, has forest logging as the name says. Has kind of large town. Moving train. Name suggests more of a woodland forest map which this definitely is not.

<p>Yes name with lower case c heh. Config copy paste from SampleMap setup, no preview images or anything. No fields registered in the game. Another map with edges covered with rocky mountain barriers and trees copy pasted so they all look the same. Quite bad stuttering in this map, no idea why as it doesnt look super detailed, maybe the models are just so bad, no idea. Anyways no fields so this is obviously work in progress map.

<p>Map overview text is in Ukrainian, non english language is always short sighted. Nice "skybox" on the edge horizon, not seen many of these. Has some rough elevations and elevation changes in general. The farms look dirty and used which is nice.

<p>Mountains indeed. Impassable insane large mountains, playing area very small. Basically that huge NW brown area which extends to center of the map is off limits as there is no way to drive vehicles there and its just rocky mountains. Sorry to say but this is not usable farming map.

<p>Well here is genuinely great name for a map, sigh. If you cant come up with a name for your project, don't do the whole thing. Well looking at the map overview, you can immediately tell the dev had as much patience to make a map than to pick a name for it ... Useless, just useless...

<p>Another one of these with wasted space on the edges. SW edges mine is copy paste from some other map. Tiny map area edges are covered with small hills which you can pass into the nomans land. Otherwise map has bit of rolling hills feeling and quite bit of forest tree areas.

<p>Large forestry logging areas in map edges, especially in E. However all trees are copy pasted without rotation in perfect rows which looks extremely repeating. Roads are all perfectly even terrain elevation but all fields have rised smooth elevations which looks like they are bulging, very bad. Other than that, guess its OK looking map.

<p>Small forestry logging area in SE corner. Trees around the roads / fields are copy pasted without anykind of randomness, so they look very repeating. Also the tree 3D models have something wrong in the level of detail's (LOD) as they aren't drawn until very close, so trees pop up very badly. Map edges blocked with texture plane of horizon, which is kind of okay but this texture don't look so good, hopefully the plane at least block vehicles from passing. Flat terrain with couple of ditch exceptions. Overall OK looking map except the LOD popping trees.

Animated pre placed cows, pigs and sheeps. Kind of large town, but some buildings are without road access so they stand out a bit. Few cars driving off map in S and some object floating there too.

<p>v1.0 by Mappers Paradise. From modDesc: Welker Farms Inc. Welcome to the real Welker Farms Inc. Welker Farms is located in North Central Montana and has been around since 1912. Now it's your turn to run this Farm.
</p>

<p>
Very nice looking terrain with Big Bud capability for larger scale operations, only issues if not plain bugs are that the vehicle shop yard is way too small, farm silo capacity is ridiculous 100,000 liters and there are no animals besides chickens.
</p>

<p>
Freezes on map loading with FS17_AnimalNotifications.zip, log shows error something about "cow" value being assigned nil or something.
</p>

<p>
Overall map at first impression looks nice, wide open spaces for that Big Bud love and most importantly, no fences. No animals, only chickens which doesnt require any tending.
</p>

<p>
Shop has items spawned very close and facing the fence so you cannot get tractor to pickup equipment other than to push them around. Not a showstopper but really annoying anyways. Coolamon Mother Bin the biggest one cant be properly spawned at the shop, it clips on top of the fence.
</p>

<p>
Welker grain elevator trigger is very poorly placed, no way to setup courseplay to catch it. Not that it would do much good as the grain silo has 100,000 liter capacity which is filled with two truck loads.

<h2>SouthDakota.zip</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by JamieFeterl. From modDesc: EastRiver-WestRiver, SouthDakota V1.1. Two very dissimilar regions... One state... Divided by the Missourii River... Put simply, this is a confusing, huge map. People not familiar with my maps might need to consult the manual.  There is not enough room here to explain it all, but if you know how to properly use the PDA, the chart below,  the road signs, and common sense, you should be fine. You start owning four state of the art farms, a large dairy, chicken complex, hog confinement, and a sheep ranch. Farm your 4000+ acres, do jobs outside the farm for extra cash, and buy out the smaller farms since they are retiring.

v2.0 by Blueweb. From modDesc: Mills County. Mills County map for FS17. Welcome to Mills County. You initially own 3 fields near a small farm. There are 10 fully functional farms with their own storage to play on. They range from very small to very large (buildings available and grain storage). All bin systems are expandable and many of the farms have seed/fertilizer/lime storage that need to be replenished. These are the Meridian bins are some of the farms. Your options for crops are the default ones plus millet (sorghum), oats, and rye. The Mills Coop and CPS provide provisions for seed, fertlizer, and lime sales.  Most of the farms also have a vehicle shop trigger in their sheds to allow for vehicle customization. This is especially useful when playing with Seasons mod as there is a maintenance requirement which can only be accessed at this trigger. Included are working pneumatic lifts. There are a few sell points around the map that accept various crop types.There is also a large dairy farm, hog farm (with manual ventilation), and sheep farm. All important points should be marked on the PDA. This map is made to play with Seasons mod. When using this mod, the trees and ground foliage will change dependant on the season and temperature. There is a snowmask in effect on road and in buildings (sheds are safe storage points for bales). The climate is customized for the midwest United States, so you will experience warm summers and cold winters. Please see the Seasons mod help text in game for all the changes and requirements...there are many!

</p>

<p>
Note: modDesc german language states "oklahomav1" heh. Also as you can see modDesc still has samplemap text so, there is that. This size is 1.7gb with huge amounts of mods used for factories / production, with such terrains there is always the fear of bloated savegame files which cause performance issues, hopefully its not the case with this one (difficult to find out as it requires extensive testing). Apparently is 4km terrain and has 51 fields.

v1.0 by Richard - NLD Farmers. From modDesc: Oregon Springs 17. Welcome to Oregon Springs. The base of the map is made from Google Earth and changed a bit to make it more enjoyable for the game. This is my first American styled map and originally built for Farming Simulator 15, but it was released in the last 2 weeks before Farming simulator 17 came out. So i decided to bring the map to Farming Simulator 17, i hope you all enjoy the map and feel free to give me some feedback to improve the map. All the base functions from the game are in the map, the only thing is there is only 1 field where you can use the missions system and this is field 5. This is because of the shapes of the fields. This version is for PC only because of the script. I would like to thank all the modders for there objects that i used, and the people in our team for testing the map. The map has all the base fs17 functions. Custom crops with new textures, Multi Terrain Angle added, Changed environment.xml and Chopped Straw is added. There are 3 different farms for the animals. 4 crops selling points. 2 Contractor areas and one of them has an extra storage for crops. Biogas. gardencenter. chicken farm where you can sell grass, hay and straw. Sawmill and on the same terrain you can sell your wood chips. Live stock market. Vehicle shop. And next to the ''trainstation'' you can sell your logs and wood.
<br>
Welcome in Oregon Springs! Here you can be the farmer that you always wanted to be. Harvest all the fields or take care of the animals, and if you need a break go out to the forest and be a lumberjack.
</p>

<p>
Oregon Springs (from someones twitch stream) doesn't look like 4km one or any way capable of big bud. Also it has spring colored trees here and there which look like crap.
