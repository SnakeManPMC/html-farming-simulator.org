	<h2>HOWTO Test New Maps</h2>

<p>In order to enjoyable play in a map you need to test that there are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Crops. Well doh obviously!</li>
	<li>Farm has room to maneuvre. Too "quake l3v3l!!1", claustrophobic farm object placement is horror. I don't necessarily mean you have to have space for dozen Big Bud 747's, but if you cant drive your harvester there, then whats the point?</li>
	<li>Grain silos. Some place for you to store your grain in the farm, so you dont have to sell it right away</li>
	<li>Grain selling points. Well quite obvious but still</li>
	<li>Roads are not too narrow. Yes, we all love BIG BUD :)</li>
	<li>Fences arent restricting movement to prevent good gameplay</li>
	<li>Forestry. At least little bit</li>
	<li>Animals; chickens, pigs, cows and sheep</li>
	<li>Water. Animal caretaking</li>
	<li>Train. Not necessary but very big bonus</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Maps / Terrains</h2>

<p>Click the images to open large in new tab.
</p>

<p>4X maps or larger 16x sized maps. Assuming 4X means 4096 and 16X 8192.

	<h2>16X Maps</h2>

<h2>Broad Acres</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Broad-Acres.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Broad-Acres.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Broad Acres" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Every single field is ruined with fences that are <b>tightly</b> right next to the fields edge AND the fences have gates which you must open, gates where you cant drive Big Bud tractor through. Good job using fences to ruin what other wise looks like a promising map :(
</p>

<p>Trees are also one type, oriented the same way so they look absolutely horrible when placed more than once. Why is it that map makers cannot use different type of trees with sizes and shapes to break out the ugly repetitive look (this is really universal problem in FS17 maps).
</p>

<p>Starting equipment lineup makes no sense, huge fleet of harvesters but no trailers to ferry the harvest and no plough, seeder, etc. Heh, hilarious. Of course players are free to sell this useless lineup and purchase their own, but anyone who wants to play this map as its developer intended is out of luck.
</p>

<p>Stupid meaningless railroad tracks that block access with harvester with header on tow (gets stuck) as are other vehicles too. The main farm or industrial area is like a prison, fences here, fences there, fences everywhere... why, just <i>why?</i>, sigh.
</p>

<h2>Corn Belt, Corn_Belt_16fach</h2>

<a href="images/Map-CornBelt.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-CornBelt.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Cornbelt" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Total of 65 fields. Has desert, sandy brown overall look near your farm, green else where. Map-view looks like it has no roads, cant tell how to drive from one place to another. Your farm is pretty nice and detailed, but has that brown dried up coloring on the ground. Field 35 (and who knows how many others) dont register to courseplay, you have to calculate the field edge yourself first.
</p>

<p>A lot of fields in the sense that there is not much of wasted space, its all fields one next to another. Kind of a nice highway system. Huge bridge over very deep river canyon, although looks bit silly as the river is then like -1m deep heh. Few trees are dangerously close to the highway and one walk-way overpass so driving along with Big Bud with Seed Hawk in tow... it most likely gets stuck, unless you drive in the middle of the highway which would be odd.
</p>

<p>Overall pretty decent looking map, takes huge amount of time to get familiar because its so packed with fields and 16x map size.
</p>

<h2>FS_2017_Maize_Map_16x, FS_2017_Maize_Map_16x</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Maize.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Maize.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Maize" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Just one insane large corn field with your farm (so to speak) in the middle of it with BGA and some stuff. Yes this is 16x map but unless you are some corn megalomaniac... this is not really a proper map heh. All respect for making 16x map, of course, but just hoping there was at least few other fields available (not to mention animals etc).
</p>

<h2>Dakota 16 (version A3), Dakota16</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Dakota-16x.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Dakota-16x.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Dakota 16" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Total of 126 fields registered (courseplay finds). View of the map looks very busy. Has airport. Feels like a huge place with many interesting locations. Some of the fields are bit off, like corn across a road etc. Overall though its a bit rough map.
</p>

<p>Has a highway which connects across the map nicely for quick travel, few bridges look bit tight not sure if Big Bud with Seed Hawk can pass through.
</p>

<h2>North West Texas</h2>

<a href="images/Map-North-West-Texas.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-North-West-Texas.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - North West Texas" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>North West Texas by Txzar
</p>

<p>Hungs with too many mod's loaded (and I mean huge loads of them), alone it works. On quick glance looks like large terrain what I'm looking for. Looks pretty low res or rather quality when compared to official Goldcrest Valley terrain.
</p>

<p>Does not have grain silo marked on the map, but its there so you have to find it. There is three silos and they hold incredible amount of crops, one time I managed to dump 700,000 liters there so not sure what the limit per silo is (and you have three of them).
</p>

<p>Your farm is not properly lighted at night, very difficult to navigate on some parts. Nights sometime get pitch black, you cannot see a thing. This depends on the weather or clouds or something, sometimes you get like moonlight scene and can see just fine for night environment.
</p>

<p>Some trees have white flickering parts which move when you move, odd. Some other conflicting faulty mod causes stutter, quite bad and I will not play on this terrain if it really stutters this bad, but this was solved by removing most of the other (useless) mods.
</p>

<p>Lighting of sun comes from opposite direction. Not sure if this is bug just in this map or basic game engine bug. Looks odd though that sun is rising and shadows come towards it heh.
</p>

<p>Field 28 has fence around it which also has very narrow gate, so no way to drive large harvester through it, even semi truck has problems with higher speed. Field 34 has only route to it blocked by narrow fence entry which wont allow harvester to pass, well unless you drive it manually and cheat with geometry. Painful.
</p>

<p>Fields 33 - 35 are cut off from wide vehicle traffic. No way no chance to get wide harvester there because of only one narrow fence entry. Also semi truck trailer geometry clips on the railroad tracks which are just beyond the fence entry. Needs urgentry quick fix to remove couple of fence pieces so wide vehicles can pass without problems.
</p>

<p>Tree planting (pallet saplings) with damcon pl-75 does not work.
</p>

<h2>North West Texas Revisited Beta</h2>

<a href="images/Map-North-West-Texas-Revisited.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-North-West-Texas-Revisited.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - North West Texas Revisited (beta)" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>North West Texas Revisited Beta by Txzar
</p>

<p><b>2018-07-06 this map is v0.9.2.1</b> and only available to download from "pinned post" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/txzarmapping/" target="_blank">txzarmapping</a> page.
</p>

<p>Looks very much changed from the old version, I didnt recognize the old farm anymore, many more silos which use I'm not sure of (store grain? seeds? something?). Most fields were gone, they were grass now.
</p>

<p>This map has low and high view distance versions for your to choose (downloads), the higher version requires more powerful hardware.
</p>

<p>Sorghum and cotton crop types. Cotton is harvested with corn header.
</p>

<p>Animated train (not the one that players can use). Railroad tracks run across the map in south from east to west direction. When train goes off the map it stays there quite while which is nice because if would be too much activity if it would loop back immediately. This train has geometry so you have to be really careful with courseplay routes when acrossing the railroad tracks not to collide with the train and go flying high.
</p>

<p>Large silos were added in the open gravel area next to field 5.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately new fences were added around some of the fields, which I assume was made to match the blue lines in the PDA map image what I read Txzar saying being property lines.
</p>


<h2>Newlin</h2>

<p>Newlin by Txzar
</p>

<p><b>2018-07-06 this map is v1.0</b> and only available to download from "pinned post" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/txzarmapping/" target="_blank">txzarmapping</a> page.
</p>

<p>Next terrain from Txzar the maker of North West Texas.
</p>

<p>This map has low and high view distance versions for your to choose (downloads), the higher version requires more powerful hardware.
</p>

<p>Skybox is animated meaning clouds move, well kind of, its the whole sky with everything thats moving. It is really fast too, very unrealistic looking and all I can hope is that Txzar fixes this on upcoming versions.
</p>

<p>**Exploring Map Work In Progress** but looks like <b>almost every field is blocked by fence and super narrow gate</b>, this is devastating effect for enjoyable game-play as you cannot use large equipment and even small equipment gets stuck very easily :-(
</p>

<p>Field 17 is covered with fences, its like a prison, Big Bud not allowed to enter. And because of the field shape and the fences, courseplay overloader just wont work :(
</p>

<p>Many fences around places that should not have them, I mean seriously do farmers fear that their fields get stolen if there are no fence to block field thieves? :)
</p>

<p>Not just on this map but in Farming Simulator 17 in general fences are bad, really bad. Yeah I mean I guess they look ok sometimes, but when they prevent you from travelling freely it is terrible and now I am not talking about short cutting across the whole map through every field, but just common sense that if you have to go around one kilometer distance for no reason, it makes just no sense. Seriously fences are to keep animals in when talked about the average farm fences, why are fields fenced? I just don't get it.
</p>

<p>Field 17 has trees so close to the headland that harvester with its pipe out will get stuck :(
</p>

<p>Field 9 and 28 gate (same as any other?) is this standard model used on many maps, it barely and I mean just barely fits Big Bud through and you will get stuck if you are not super careful. Highly annoying fence gate.
</p>

<p>Field 32 has narrow gate and powerline pole right next to the gate.
</p>

<p>Sorghum, cotton and feed corn crop types. Cotton is harvested with corn header.
</p>

<p>Animated train (not the one that players can use) on south west corner of the map running diagonally. You can see the train beyond map edge when it turns around, actually flips around which looks ugly. The train passes through way too often, its like constant train traffic which will get really old when you play more than couple of hours and see the train go back and forth for like a thousand times heh. Train should pass perhaps only once an hour or even less, maybe randomly if its possible in FS17.
</p>

<p>Train has no collision so there is no issue with your courseplay etc driven vehicles.
</p>

<p>Traffic is quite nasty, as always, but it can be turned off from options so its not a big deal.
</p>

<p>Your farm grain silo is located about middle of the map, between fields 12, 32, 9 and 28. Sell points are marked on the map as usual.
</p>

<p>You can cut trees (tested few types in one of the big fields) and then plough some nice big fields, but also if you cut too many trees it takes away from the beauty of this map as well so be mindful of that.
</p>

<h2>Rattlesnake Valley</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Rattlesnake-Valley.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Rattlesnake-Valley.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Rattlesnake Valley" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Looks OK but still has bit maze alike farm, very narrow roads with geometry blocks on the side so forget Big Bud. Looks like almost all roads have fences which is really bad. NE edge has some rocky mountain side with "level" stuff which is annoying.
</p>

<h2>Greatfields, GreatfieldsBETA6</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Greatfields.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Greatfields.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Greatfields" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Insane 600ha field haha! On quick glance looks great, better than North West Texas. Huge mountrain edge "skybox" backdrop texture planes, looks massive. Large hillside on S-SW part. Extremely large forestry logging area in NW corner.
</p>

<p>However this is same as pleasant valley that it uses goldcrest valley as copy pasted base and the map has just been extended around it. Greatfields is not goldcrest copy though, it only has small areas that are directly from it.
</p>

<h2>Saxonia</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Saxonia.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Saxonia.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Saxonia" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Train tracks. Very nice map which includes large fields and level terrain. Airbase is also included where Tordnado jets are taking off and landing, very cool.
</p>

<h2>Loess Hill Country</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Loess-Hill-Country.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Loess-Hill-Country.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Loess Hill Country" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>A bit more narrower roads again, seems to have no missions. Extremely mild rolling hills theme going on. Some forest spots. Few odd fields with some sort of bush type trees there.
</p>

<h2>Germantown</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Germantown.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Germantown.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Germantown" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Incredible 148 fields. Small rolling hills theme going on. A lot of forestry logging trees around. Train tracks. Some rocky small hills (very small spots). Very nice looking european terrain.
</p>

<h2>Pleasant Valley v17</h2>

<p>Original goldcrest valley is on the center, but now its enlargened from 2048 (2x I guess) into 4X map size. Many things have been added to the extra terrain space, looks nice. However it has quite hefty required mods list.
</p>

<h2>Missouri River Bottoms 17, MissouriRiverBottoms</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Missouri-River-Bottoms-17.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Missouri-River-Bottoms-17.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Missouri River Bottoms 17" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Have huge train tracks. Aircrafts, helicopters and blimps flying around (not really sure if that is cool as there are so many of them). Animated horses. Moving trains. Ugly flicker on some of the skybox like "side panel" textures. Map feels little bit too "busy" if you know what I mean.
</p>

<h2>County Line FS17, FS17_CountyLine</h2>

<a href="images/Map-County-Line-FS17.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-County-Line-FS17.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - County Line FS17" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Animated horses. Moving train. Some forest logging areas. Dirt and paved roads. Very nice looking map, I would say top quality on quick look.
</p>

<h2>Dondiego Map Ls17, DondiegoMap_Ls17</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Dondiego-Map-Ls17.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Dondiego-Map-Ls17.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Dondiego Map Ls17" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Map edges are covered with rocky mountain barrier. Total of 72 fields. Dirt and paved roads. Quite bit of forestry logging. Very nice open areas for Big Bud usage, not sure about some of the bridge choke points though. Overall flat terrain elevations. This is good looking map.
</p>

<h2>Monchwinkel - Landkreis Oder-Spree, FS17_Moenchwinkel</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Monchwinkel.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Monchwinkel.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Monchwinkel" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Holy smokes 91 fields. Many trees around the fields and some forests areas too, seems to have more of those "round" non-pine trees which name I don't know, dunno if those can be forestry logged. Train tracks for players and animated trains in N edge and NW corner. Edges of the map has nice buffer area of sparse round trees. Feels very much like european germany terrain. This is nice looking map, perhaps more looking like a ArmA 3 terrain than FS17 farming map.
</p>

<h2>Sued Thueringen, FS17_SuedThueringen_v3</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Sued-Thueringen.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Sued-Thueringen.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Sued Thueringen" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>On the edges there are a lot of tree texture planes and behind them some low poly tree objects (I believe these are large forest blocks) to take up perfectly good space, some of the planes you can pass through, others aren't, I don't get it. Especially in NW corner there is huge area of these low poly tree objects. Seems to me like otherwise perfectly fine looking 4X map was ruined with these stupid low poly tree objects. Other than that the map looks decent, which is shame because I cannot comprehend why any dev would ruin his otherwise nice map with the mentioned forest blocks.
</p>

<h2>The Moris Land, The_Moris_Land_v2</h2>

<a href="images/Map-The-Moris-Land.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-The-Moris-Land.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - The Moris Land" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Huge fields, definitely Big Bud country heh. Field 19 has incredible expandability. SW corner has insanely large forestry logging area. Quite flat terrain. Skybox ends too soon in SE and NW corners. This looks like very nice map indeed.
</p>

<h2>Wisconsin Illinois Border, WisconsinIllinoisBorderv1_1</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Wisconsin-Illinois-Border.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Wisconsin-Illinois-Border.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Wisconsin Illinois Border" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Moderately flat terrain, small bumbs here and there. Large forest logging area west central and north edges. Large fields and open areas, feels like Big Bud country. This is very nice basic map indeed.
</p>

<h2>Cherry Hills 2017, cherryHills2017byStevie</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Cherry-Hills-2017.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Cherry-Hills-2017.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Cherry Hills 2017" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Nice "skybox" background after map edges. Edges have nice set of forest trees, many tree types and placed randomly which looks very natural. Large forestry logging area in NW corner. Train tracks. Little bit symmetrical map, train tracks and those concrete areas in the edges, not too bad though. Tiny amount of rolling hills mood on the fields (as name should suggest, hills). Few rocky spots with trees between the fields. This map definitely has lot of trees to cut down if thats your choice. This is good looking map for sure.
</p>

<h2>Western Australia v1.1 Beta, Western_AustraliaX</h2>

<p>No fields registered in the game. Very much work in progress.
</p>

<h2>Kernstadt 2017, KernstadtMF2017</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Kernstadt-2017.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Kernstadt-2017.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Kernstadt 2017" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Small edge rocky mountain blocks but that is not too bad. Some forestry logging area in S-SW. Train tracks. Large forest area in N at some odd elevated terrain level. Very wild terrain in N-NE corner. Terrain elevations for rest of the areas is very smooth, only minor changes, looks good. This is overall good looking map if we forget the odd rocky corner area.
</p>

<h2>Sudharz, LS17_Suedharz_Map</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Sudharz.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Sudharz.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Sudharz" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Rolling hills terrain elevations. Huge amount of forest logging areas. This map looks like its made from satellite imagery, but its baffling why half of the map is unfinished, unless its just to honor the spirit of FS17 community; leave most of the map empty because you're too lazy to finish it. SW corner field also has some red transparent geometry block, must be a bug. So yeah I really hope dev will finish this map as it has great potential.
</p>

<h2>MIG Map MadeInGermany Celle, MIG_MadeInGermany_Region_Celle_byBullgore_Beta__1_</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Mig-Map-Germany-Celle.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Mig-Map-Germany-Celle.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - MIG Map MadeInGermany Celle" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Interesting name, not sure if that MadeInGermany should somehow be in the name, I think its just stupid naming, I bet this maps real name is just Celle, which is location in germany. Ugly off the map well texture I guess, transparent and looking bad. Large amount of 121 fields. Map made out of satellite imagery so it looks great, realistic map. Huge forestry logging area in SE, NE corners and trees cover most of the map edges and field edges. Great looking realistic map overall.
</p>

<h2>Parkers Prairie, Parkers_Prairie_v1_4_2</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Parkers-Prairie.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Parkers-Prairie.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Parkers Prairie" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Very nice large farm, lots of room to drive vehicles. Map edges are not usual rocky mountain block, but some grassy low hill. Bunch of trees around the edges and fields (trees are placed with variations and random rotation) which is nice. Train tracks which are not animated and don't appear to contain player drivable locomotive either. Readme stated that one of the fields (you own) is 114 hectares. This is very good looking map.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately Parkers Prairie v1.4.2 still has the pig straw location graphic missing, you have to know (by magic?) where the straw drop-off point is. It is located next to the fence just right of the gate. You just have to use telehandler and slowly drive back and forth with straw bale close to the ground to see where it disappears (or you could use the development mode and F5 to check the trigger location).
</p>

<p>Night time in Parkers Prairie is fine, the light levels of the night change according to weather / clouds, sometimes its very dark and most of the time there is enough ambient light that you see to drive vehicles around larger obstacles etc. Very enjoyable night time.
</p>

<h2>Rocky Valley, Felsental</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Rocky-Valley.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Rocky-Valley.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Rocky valley" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>All but N side of the map blocked out by odd rocky mountains and most of the S side as you can see from the retarded german cowboys big-fat-cow logo. Also rocky mountains at the center of map too. Shame they had to ruin good 4X map base doing that. Anyways there are lot of forestry logging possibilities for those who are interested in this map, I ain't.
</p>


<h2>Plains and Simple Seasons 4X by Stevie, FS17_PlainsAndSimpleSeasons4xPByStevie</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Plains-And-Simple-Seasons-4x.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Plains-And-Simple-Seasons-4x.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Plains and Simple Seasons 4x by Stevie" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Square fields which is always easier for stuff like courseplay. Animals require special foods like sheeps need something called lucerne and cows need something called proteinSilage, I'm not a big fan of these customized fruits or whatever they are called, stick to the standards what everyone knows.
</p>

<p>Overall very solid and nice map.
</p>

	<h2>PMC Tested Maps</h2>

<p>Maps listed below are default 2X 2048 size if not mentioned otherwise, basically 4X maps are listed under the, well, 4X Maps header.
</p>

<p>Version numbers are not listed because these maps often times get updated very frequently, so listing a version number is kind of outdated very easily. Also as the FS17 mod download sites are such a garbage, its sometimes difficult to find latest version of released mod.
</p>

<h2>American Outback</h2>

<p>Stupid fictional newbie looking place, very narrow roads like fence right at the road, heh.
</p>

<h2>Chellington 17 v2</h2>

<p>Super claustrophobic, feel depressed on mission start in the farm, ugh. No chance whatsoever to operate any large vehicles in this terrain (farm) haha.
</p>

<h2>Coldborough Park Farm</h2>

<p>Claustrophobic shit, BRITISH terrain with shitty hedgerows. Avoid this.
</p>

<h2>American Farm</h2>

<p>Bit odd as the fields cost like 100's of millions euros, eh?
</p>

<h2>Black Mountain, Montana</h2>

<p>I guess its okay, some parts look quite tight, dunno.
</p>

<h2>Small Town USA</h2>

<p>Looks okay I guess.

<a href="images/Map-Alberta-Canada.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Alberta-Canada.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Alberta Canada" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Nice and clean simple map, open smooth areas and large looking fields, no large hills in fact the map is almost completely flat which is not a bad thing.
</p>

<h2>Broxton, FS17_Broxton</h2>

<p>Broxton. Based on 70's Broxton/Duckington area in south west Cheshire England.
</p>

<a href="images/Map-Broxton.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Broxton.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Broxton" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Pre placed sheep models. Custom fruits. Artificial barrier on the map edges, not even close to the real end of the map but like 200 coordinates earlier, so 2X map has been made intentionally smaller. Its OK looking I guess, but I can't imagine ever playing on this map.
</p>

<h2>Crampton Isle, FS17_CramptonIsle</h2>

<p>What the hell is this? :o Developer didn't want to make even 2X sized map so he made this tiny crap? hehe, damn man...
</p>

<h2>Dutch Polder, FS17_dutchPolder</h2>

<p>This map is based on an existing area in the Netherlands, where developers father has a farm.
</p>

<a href="images/Map-Dutch-Polder.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Dutch-Polder.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Dutch Polder" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Quite flat area as Holland should be heh. Artificial border on the edges so I doubt will be playing this because that puts me off. Otherwise nice decent looking map.
</p>

<h2>FS17 Farming Legend, FS17_Farming_Legend</h2>

<p>This is map from FS11 apparently.

<p>Little bit odd map with the high hills and the water. Not for me, can't imagine playing there.
</p>

<h2>Hagenstedt, FS17_Hagenstedt</h2>

<p>This is map from FS13 apparently.
</p>

<a href="images/Map-Hagenstedt.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Hagenstedt.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Hagenstedt" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Many rocky hills / mountains, seems like tons of geometry blocks for larger vehicles. Many different elevation plateaus, this map looks like anti-Big Bud heh.
</p>

<h2>Islands, FS17_Islands</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Islands.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Islands.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Islands" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>What an creative name, hoh. This is actual island with water around it even though you cannot see it from the map overview. Large forestry area in NW.
</p>

<h2>Lone Star, FS17_LoneStar_V2</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Lone-Star.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Lone-Star.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Lone Star" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Texas Lone Star, nice Texas flag to keep the spirits up. Many trees so great logging forestry possibilities. Lakes with ducks and fishes is a nice touch. Only 17 fields but they are quite large. Very nice looking map.
</p>

<h2>Lost_Islands, FS17_Lost_Islands</h2>

<p>Yes the name is with underscore.
</p>

<a href="images/Map-Lost-Islands.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Lost-Islands.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Lost_Islands" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Tropical palm tree islands connected with bridges. Talking about farming equipment out of place, wow. It would feel so weird farming in this environment.
</p>

<h2>New Bartelshagen, FS17_Neu_Bartelshagen</h2>

<a href="images/Map-New-Bartelshagen.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-New-Bartelshagen.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - New Bartelshagen" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Very large fields, field 6 is 47 hectares. Map is surrounded by water but it doesn't feel like island, there is artificial edge where the water starts but that is almost on the real map coordinate edge already so its not that limiting factor.
</p>

<h2>Southquebec, FS17_southquebec</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Southquebec.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Southquebec.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Southquebec" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Field 2 is 50 hectares. Horrible looking rows of trees as they are copy pasted without any rotation variation so they look fake. Also train tracks are very symmertical which again, looks so fake.
</p>

<h2>Vogelsberg, FS17_Vogelsberg</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Vogelsberg.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Vogelsberg.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Vogelsberg" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Umm what? Looking at the map overview... err do I need to say more? :) Anyways the tiny map area is surrounded by rocky mountains which block you from moving further out. This is good example where dude wanted to make a map, but didn't have patience to create full size 2X map, guess he didnt even have skills to make 1X map heh.
</p>

<h2>Woodshire, FS17_Woodshire</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Woodshire.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Woodshire.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Woodshire" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Oh wow another one with tiny area for map, why not just create full 1X map instead? Otherwise it looks OK, lots of trees and basic map in the tiny area surrounded by rocky mountain block.
</p>

<h2>Northern Alberta, NORTHERN_ALBERTA_V1</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Northern-Alberta.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Northern-Alberta.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Northern Alberta" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Very flat terrain, no hills, which is totally OK. Nice looking map. Feels eerily like "Alberta Canada, Alberta_Farms" map but maybe its just me.
</p>

<h2>Turfway, TURFWAY</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Turfway.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Turfway.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Turfway" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Uses the default goldcrest valley starter area, but only few buildings or small area. Surrounded by rocky mountains, also bit rocky on the basic areas. No real roads, only dirt paths in otherwise grass area. Two train tracks. Probably usable map for Big Bud DLC.
</p>

<h2>Central Ohio, Central_OhioV1</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Central-Ohio.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Central-Ohio.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Central Ohio" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Large forest area in SE. Quite flat terrain. Some yellow trigger areas floating in the air above the west-central forest. Basic nice map.
</p>

<h2>Kendle Farm, FS17_KendleFarm_Pc</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Kendle-Farm.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Kendle-Farm.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Kendle Farm" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Oh man one of these tiny maps again... and super claustrophobic farm where you can barely walk out without getting stuck to some geometry blocks. Sigh. Why not make this as 0.5X map haha. What is this, farm sim or pac-man hehe.
</p>


<h2>Mustang Valley Ranch, FS17_Mustang_Valley_Ranch</h2>

<p>Dry brownish desert looking map. Only five fields but largest of them are 104 and 80 hectares. Interesting map, might be some work in those large fields for Big Bud. BTW I heard from somewhere that this a large map, it is not, this is default 2X map.
</p>

<h2>AGRO Moravany V2, AGRO_Moravany_V2LS17</h2>

<p>Not the absolutely tiniest map, but yeah its right up there. Looks like it has large forest area on the edges but its fake, only small rows of trees and rest is "skybox" texture planes. There is only one field which is registered by the game and its far off the tiny map area, its located on the NW corner and looks like its kind of bugged or maybe even forgotten there. I believe this map is very heavily work in progress or just, really odd heh.
</p>

<h2>American Wood Map, American_Wood_Map</h2>

<p>Kind of sandy colored brown, dryish map, has forest logging as the name says. Has kind of large town. Moving train. Name suggests more of a woodland forest map which this definitely is not.
</p>

<h2>challans, Challan</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Challans.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Challans.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - challans" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Yes name with lower case c heh. Config copy paste from SampleMap setup, no preview images or anything. No fields registered in the game. Another map with edges covered with rocky mountain barriers and trees copy pasted so they all look the same. Quite bad stuttering in this map, no idea why as it doesnt look super detailed, maybe the models are just so bad, no idea. Anyways no fields so this is obviously work in progress map.
</p>

<h2>DolgosFalva, Dolgosfalva_map_Fs17</h2>

<p>No fields registered in the game. Looks like very work in progress map and ugly one at that.
</p>

<p>Fake forest texture planes in middle of the map, which you cannot pass through, I don't get it. Trees by the road on middle of the map look very repeating. Otherwise it might be decent looking map.
</p>

<h2>Altenstein, FS17_Altenstein</h2>

<a href="images/Map-Altenstein.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-Altenstein.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - Altenstein" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Oh please with these tiny maps, a real bad excuses for map from authors who are too lazy to create even normal size 2X map. To top that off its got super claustrophobic farm. Roger that, skip this one.
</p>

<h2>FS17_AstonManor</h2>

<p>Some tiny claustrophobic SampleMap crap. Map background image from goldcrest valley. Config is copy paste from SampleMap, including the name for crying out loud :(
</p>

<h2>Petrowka, FS17_Petrowka</h2>

<p>Map overview text is in Ukrainian, non english language is always short sighted. Nice "skybox" on the edge horizon, not seen many of these. Has some rough elevations and elevation changes in general. The farms look dirty and used which is nice.
</p>

<h2>Valley Crest, FS17_Valley_Crest</h2>

<p>Edited goldcrest valley, so crap, skip this.
</p>

<h2>Goldcrest Mountains, Goldcrest_Mountains</h2>

<p>Mountains indeed. Impassable insane large mountains, playing area very small. Basically that huge NW brown area which extends to center of the map is off limits as there is no way to drive vehicles there and its just rocky mountains. Sorry to say but this is not usable farming map.
</p>

<h2>NF_Marsch, NF_Marsch</h2>

<p>Tree placement is nicely random. Quite flat terrain. Okay looking map.

<p>Well here is genuinely great name for a map, sigh. If you don't know name for your project, don't do it. Well looking at the map overview, you can immediately tell the dev had as much patience to make a map than to pick a name for it ... Useless, just useless...
</p>

<h2>Space Valley, SpaceValley</h2>

<p>Another one of these with wasted space on the edges due dev being lazy to make full sized map, seems to be a trend in FS17 community. SW edges mine is copy paste from some other map. Tiny map area edges are covered with small hills which you can pass into the nomans land. Otherwise map has bit of rolling hills feeling and quite bit of forest tree areas.
</p>

<h2>Westbridge Hills, WBH</h2>

<p>Little bit of rolling hill mood. Edges have rocky mountain blocks and some rock hills in center of the map too. Nice looking rolling hills map, not too much wide open spaces.
</p>

<p>A lot of vegetation, feels quite busy place, claustrophobic tight spots (dont bring Big Bud here). Animated train. Huge amounts of empty wasted space on NW, N, NE and SE, which is really a shame.
</p>

<h2>ModMap_16Fach_by_RC_Devil</h2>

<p>It says "15814.57 Acres big bga mais" on the mod name, huh what? But that is a moot point because the whole map doesnt work, nothing shows up in-game. Good job on this release, double thumbs up!
</p>

<p>Rock wall barrier at the edges. Forestry logging area in SE corner. Odd "levels" in the terrain, doesn't look nice, but major fields are on the flat terrain area.
</p>

<p>No fields registered in the game. Small part of southern edge blocked off for unknown reason. Flying hot air balloons. Ugly looking map edge "skybox" texture planes. Small hills. Many trees around fields. Two rocky hill spots in center of the map.
</p>

<p>Not the largest but nice looking farm area, this is one of the largest and nicest farm areas in these standard sizes maps I have seen. Few small forestry logging areas. Totally flat terrain elevations (I could not quickly find any hills or even bumbs). Very nice looking map.
</p>

<p>Tiny area from lazy devs once again, this is the pattern in FS17 map modding community, which is truly a shame. I mean why bother even making maps if you are using just tiny area blocking the rest off, then make 0.5X map instead for crying out loud. Could not exit the game, it just returned back to game heh.

<p>Large forestry logging areas in map edges, especially in E. However all trees are copy pasted without rotation in perfect rows which looks extremely repeating. Roads are all perfectly even terrain elevation but all fields have rised smooth elevations which looks like they are bulging, very bad. Other than that, guess its OK looking map.

<p>Nice difference there in mod name and file name. No fields registered in the map, not that there are many, three I think hehe. Interesting looking mountain terrain, but not really useful for farming. Also like half the map is empty blocked off stuff, as usual.

<p>Flat terrain. Train tracks. The large light brown area you see on west side of the map, is NOT a field, its water in-game. Its a shame that half of the map is not used as the one that is, does show some promise. Maybe the dev will finish the west side in future releases, we can only hope...

<p>Small forestry logging area in SE corner. Trees around the roads / fields are copy pasted without anykind of randomness, so they look very repeating. Also the tree 3D models have something wrong in the level of detail's (LOD) as they aren't drawn until very close, so trees pop up very badly. Map edges blocked with texture plane of horizon, which is kind of okay but this texture don't look so good, hopefully the plane at least block vehicles from passing. Flat terrain with couple of ditch exceptions. Overall OK looking map except the LOD popping trees.

<p>Flat terrain. Empty space in NW and SE corners. Hot air balloon(s), aircraft and few birds (swans?) flying. Odd rocky mountain tips in N and S. Many trees, lot of forestry logging options. Animated pre placed cows, pigs and sheeps. Kind of large town, but some buildings are without road access so they stand out a bit. Few cars driving off map in S and some object floating there too. Overall OK map I guess.

<h2>XLFarms_W.I.P_and_BETA_versions</h2>

<p>1.89gb release zip. Includes two zip files (yes, inside the release zip) FS17_XLFarms_X1.zip and FS17_XLFarms_X2.zip which are two different maps. The actual map zip's together are only 1.01gb in size. Two dev log text files which start with hijo de puta language (big surprise) with english later. Includes donate txt file, sigh. To be fair to the dev it says on capital letters that it is work in progress and beta (they are pretty much the same though), but still use your fucking head before making stupid release packaging like this. Also the release zip includes, get this, <b>890 megabytes of screenshots in BMP format!</b> oh my fucking god how fucking retarded person has to be. People who make releases like this should not let be even near of computer.

<p>Says to be XL farm but still is only 2X map haha. Flat terrain. Badly pasted repeating trees. Stupid water areas with wind turbines.
</p>

<p><b>FS17_XLFarms_X2.zip</b>
</p>

<a href="images/Map-FS17_XLFarms_X2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/thumbs/Map-FS17_XLFarms_X2.jpg" alt="Farming Simulator 17 Map - FS17_XLFarms_X2" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></a>

<p>Same as above but this is 4X map, so more stupid water and wind turbines.

<h2>Zlotow TV, ZlotowTV</h2>

<p>Some work in progress crap, tiny map and no fields registered in the game, etc.
</p>

<h2>Koporstki, koporstki</h2>

<p>Probably stolen map as it uses Rolniczy Zakatek preview image, work in progress broken map.
</p>

<h2>AgroVation, FS17Contest_AgroVation</h2>

<p>No fields registered in the game. Nice looking map obviously made using satellite imagery, however its work in progress as there are buildings outside the map edge and water creeping through terrain on few spots. Totally bizarre why such WIP map was submitted to mod contest heh.
</p>

<h2>Tiroler High Mountains, TirolerHochgebirgeFS17</h2>

<p>Ridiculous mountains, no farming.
