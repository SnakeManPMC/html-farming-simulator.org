PMCTODO task, this page is a empty placeholder until Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) has been released and content created.
</p>

My life will be extremely hectic because FS25 is released on nov 12th 2024 as we all know, but also <a href="https://sea-power.pmctactical.org" target="_blank">Sea Power (Naval Combat in the Missile Age)</a> gets released in <b>the same day!</b> so I am going to be completely overwhelmed how do I divide my time between these two titles, play, learn and document everything new.
</p>

<p>
This is the reason an empty placeholder pages for many FS25 categories were created during october 2024 before the release when I have all the time in the world to edit stuff, so I don't have to spend that precious little time do I have each day after the game release to create these pages, I can just write notes and dump the text into already existing pages.
