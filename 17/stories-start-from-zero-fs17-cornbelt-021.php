2006 finished seeding F45<br>
2030 used train to pickup 67k liter of seeds and 200k liter of fertilizer from the factory, whoah nice load of fertilizer heh<br>
2104 finished seeding F44<br>
2154 started to dump potatoes into the far edge of F51
</p>

<p>
Its so painful to haul the potatoes so far to gunther for sale, so I decided to disconnect the second semi-tipper trailer, use the first 70k liter one only which makes the truck more easier / faster to drive and then I'm going to dump all the remaining potatoes at the edge of F51 where they are in nobodys way and I can access them whenever I want lateron. I can use conveyor belts to load them into trucks when the time comes.

<p>
<b>2018-10-27T0020</b> started fertilizing F49
</p>

<p>
Tried out the new bredal 20k liter spreader trailer, it was odd, courseplay complained that I need seeds for it. So I had to fake the course as normal route and slow down the speed so its not unrealistic like these losers you see in twitch streams with 21km/h speeding harvesters with 1000 meter heads etc.
</p>

<p>
? finished fertilizing F49<br>
0125 started harvesting F34, harvesting now with 4 combines <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
0131 started plowing F49, plowing now with 4 big bud 757's and SPSL 9's hehe<br>
0205 finished plowing F49<br>
0219 started fertilizing F49
</p>

<p>
Now bredal fertilizer spreader trailer works OK with courseplay. Go figure, must have been some hiccup and needed game restart, very rarely I see that happen.
