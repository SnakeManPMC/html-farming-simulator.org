	<h2>2018-11-19 Farming Simulator 19 Released Its Game Over Man</h2>

<p>

1737 started fertilizing F06<br>
1740 fertilizer market price broke 10k barrier, its now $10,040. cant wait to start running my cocaina white truck money train into gunther <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
1808 started fertilizing F34<br>
1855 finished fertilizing F06<br>
1913 started fertilizing F15<br>
1925 finished fertilizing F34<br>
1926 started fertilizing F35<br>
1937 finished fertilizing F15<br>
1939 started fertilizing F16<br>
2002 finished fertilizing F16<br>
2016 finished plowing F07<br>
2108 finished fertilizing F35<br>
2113 started fertilizing F33<br>
2135 started plowing F06<br>
2208 soybeans market price started to increase in maplefield mills, but I've been disappointed so many times that I wont hold my breath of getting a good price now.<br>
2213 finished fertilizing F33<br>
2323 started fertilizing F07<br>
2359 fertilizer market price stopped increasing at $11,662 which is not the highest but pretty decent for my purpose
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-11-20T0012</b> took semi truck of fertilizer for gunther to sell, sold $816k the first 70k liter trailer, after price went back up sold another for $816k.<br>
0024 finished fertilizing F07<br>
0039 fertilizer sold trailer for 2x $816k, budget now $7.255m
</p>

<p>
Had to bring another truck to help as the one is way too little, I had over 1 million liters fertilizer on the SW silo and train almost full (1 million liters) and manure/slurry tanks stocked up for further fertilizer manufacturing, hehe.

	<h2>2018-11-20 Farming Simulator 19 Release</h2>

<p>
<b>2018-11-20T0100 Farming Simulator 19 released! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy"></b><br>
0110 fertilizer sold trailer for 2x $816k, budget now $8.887m<br>
0111 finished plowing F06
</p>

<p>
Selling that truck load of fertilizer concluded this play session as Farming Simulator 19 had been downloaded, I'm going to start install and play that now. Remains to be seen if this log entry was the last for this savegame and who knows, maybe for FS17 all together... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
<i>Edit: 2024-03-17T04:51:59Z its fair to say that if I haven't played Farming Simulator 17 until now, it is very likely that I wont ever play it again, we now have FS19 and FS22 out, some people have already left FS19 behind and now rumors are circulating that "FS25" or something is coming soon possibly 2024, so life goes on, old games get outdated and discarded, life is sad</i> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
