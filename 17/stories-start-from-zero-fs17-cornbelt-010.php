	<h2>2018-10-15 Big Soybean Selling</h2>

0737 started fertilizing F34<br>
0754 started harvesting F44
</p>

<p>
Noticed that soybeans market price in maplefield mills had skyrocketed to $4958, so I quickly started to load train as I had already 513k liters in silos heh. Field 44 was half way harvested so I'm keeping an eye on the market price and if it doesn't start to drop I'll finish this harvest and then dump all of it for some big dollah <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

0915 started fertilizing F44<br>
0934 finished fertilizing F44<br>
0936 train hauled 595k liters of soybeans to maplefield mill SE sellpoint, sold $446k + $436k + $426k + $417k + $407k + $398k + $240k, budget now $2.951m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I think its time to go shopping! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the train selling, the price rises back up very soon after you sell that huge load, so maybe I should fill a train with expensive crops drive it to the sell point sell one car and then just wait until the price increases again, I mean the train is just a free storage place so why not. I mean there is no rule or any specific point of selling everything at once, especially trying to sell it quickly makes no difference as the price drops before you manage to move the train one car forward.
</p>

<p>
Having that $2.9m in my bank made me anxious to go Shopping! hehe, but was taking it easy trying to think whats the best course of action. Should I stay with these fields and just upgrade my equipment or buy new field and perhaps one or two equipment upgrades (depending on budget), dunno.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on that though more deeper, this from scratch game-play style is extremely long winded and hard work, I mean look at how many real life hours and days I have played already and while I do have basic vehicles and equipment with few fields... I still consider my assets being puny punk ass stuff compared to the unlimited money big bud MONSTA shizzle hehe.
</p>

<p>
Some math wizard should make correct table of the balance between number of fields / hectares and vehicles / implements, what is the perfect formula to quickest harvests. Obvious thing is that if one task takes more than one hour to complete, yeah you don't need to have many of those in a day and the day goes by in no time.
</p>

<p>
Anyways back to real world stuff... I was thinking of buying field 50 and enlarge is over the grassfield south of it. I guess that grass field might be nice to have, but its not like this terrain lacks grass so why not make big bucks soybean factory outta fifty hehe.

<p>
F34 is 29 hectares which doesn't sound too large but you can clearly tell that wow it is much bigger than my other fields or the standards I've been used to in this from scratch savegame. After I pull this harvest from all the fields, I'm definitely going to upgrade my vehicle and implements fleet to really speed up harvests.
