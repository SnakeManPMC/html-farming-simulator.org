1951 back at PMC Gaming, starting up FS17, farming continues.

Guess I was really tired as didn't even realize last night that now all my fields have been harvested, farm silo status is: 79k wheat, 250k barley and 3.576 million liters of soybeans (plus the placeable 600k of potatoes).

Damn 4 big bud seedhawk setups is nasty with courseplay, you have to separate them far apart when you send them on their way that they won't collide with each other. Seems like in the headland corners with seedhawk courseplay wants them to do 360 turn which takes time. In this time the trailing vehicle can catch up to him and... "is in traffic" hehe.

After the next crops sale I'm going to upgrade those steyr multi 4115's with KUHN EMC sprayer because its so limited capacity only 3200 liters, I'm going to get two new tractors and bredal 20k liter tank spreaders. It would be fun to spread one field with one pass instead of doing couple refills.
