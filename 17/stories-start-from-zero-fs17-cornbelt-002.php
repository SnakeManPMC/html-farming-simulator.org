1147 purchased metaltech db 8<br>

1235 started to plow F10. it was pure hell using that salford 4202 2m plow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1404 finished plowing F10<br>
1415 started cultivating F10<br>
1436 had to call it a night, was falling a sleep in front of PMC Gaming. I left it running as youtube uploads were still ongoing.
</p>


	<h2>Seeding My Very First Own Field</h2>

<p>
2240 woke up and courseplay cultivating was finished for F10 and it was night time in-game hehe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
2345 purchased front weight AGCO 650 to tractor as pulling the seeder was difficult to steer<br>
2346 refilled seeds and money dropped to about $5k, didnt have enough to purchase fertilizer placeable<br>
2350 started to seed soybeans F10 (again forgot to write down, but it was approx just before midnight. I'm too excited to play hehe).
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-07T0120</b> finished seeding F10, my first own field seeding is done! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0145 sold two trailer loads of wheat in SE sellpoint for about 2x $14k, budget now $32k<br>
0210 started to fertilize F10<br>
0226 topped off fertilizer tanks at the shop<br>
0239 finished fertilizing F10, now we again wait for crops to grow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0300 installed 5.3.25 version of courseplay and purchased solid fertilizer placeable to the shop<br>
0355 soybeans crop has fully grown on F10, starting harvest! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0527 forgot to write down when harvest finished, as I quickly sent tractor with trailers to empty them in HQ<br>
0550 started cultivating F10<br>
0651 used train to haul a bit wheat and 29k liters of soybeans to SE sell point, budget now $147k<br>
0704 finished cultivating F10<br>
0714 started seeding soybeans to F10<br>
0838 finished seeding F10
</p>

<p>
At this point its been a little boring as there is so much waiting going on when working with so few vehicles and only one field without any money so I cant do anything else, at all. But its been okay, I'm fully enjoying myself and being excited about developing my farm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
All I can say is enjoy the peace and quiet, while you can ... because once you get the fleet of Big Bud's kicking some ass on the 10+ fields, there is no rest for you at that point hehe.
</p>

<p>
0858 started to harvest soybeans from F10
</p>

<p>
A LOT of free time at this point when courseplay if running combine or tractor, seeing the tractor go 43km/h or combine using 3m header is funny to say the least. Using these kind of vehicles makes you really appreciate the monster stuff you can buy with unlimited money like cr 10.90 harvester, brent 1596 auger wagon and big bud tractors with seed hawk setups... man that is different world compared to this smallest starter kit heh.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking that any good new terrains get released I'll try this start from scratch method and farming simulator 19 does include such feature by default so I'm definitely going to do more of these as its so exciting to develop your farm from scratch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1008 finished soybean harvest on F10<br>
1024 sold 27k liters of soybean using the train, got $106k out of them, budget now $249k<br>
1026 started fertilizing F10<br>
1115 finished fertilizing and started cultivating, again forgot to write time down.
</p>

<p>
It really starts to get a bit boring at this stage, this is now the third harvest for this little 3 hectare field and I'm still looking at least two if not three harvests before I can purchase my second field which would add much to my activity.
</p>

<p>
1215 finished cultivating F10<br>
1219 started fertilizing F10<br>
1235 finished fertilizing F10<br>
1244 started seeding soybeans to F10<br>
1419 finished seeding F10<br>
1437 started harvesting soybeans F10<br>
1454 was dead tired and had to go to sleep ...
