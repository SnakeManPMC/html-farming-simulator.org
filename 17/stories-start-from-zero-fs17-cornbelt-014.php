	<h2>2018-10-19 Big Bud 747 Arrives To The Farm</h2>

<p>
0910 back at PMC Gaming, starting up FS17, we are farming again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0922 started seeding soybeans on F50<br>
0955 started harvesting F09<br>
1002 started plowing F33<br>
1034 finished seeding F50<br>
1049 finished harvesting F09<br>
1119 took train with corn (market price was $2,538) to sale, sold $362k after which market price kept rising again. sold $362k and $216k, budget now $1.831m<br>
1144 started seeding soybeans on F34<br>
1220 started fertilizing F09<br>
1240 finished fertilizing F09<br>
1249 finished plowing F33<br>

</p>

<p>
That damn F35 is causing problems for every direction, I have to buy it next just so I own it which makes those "you dont own this field" problems go away. So annoying to try to work on a field which clearly is yours but game is telling you its not, also planters and fertilizers waste a lot of product when courseplay runs on those areas. Its only $6.1m heh, let me count my pennies one sec ...
</p>

<p>
1337 purchased:<br>
- bug bud 747 with triple wheels $429k<br>

Yeaah buddy! Big Bud time! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1346 finished fertilizing F33
</p>

<p>
Man do I love Big Bud, that SPSL 9 plow which is 10.5m width just decimates those fields when you are used to these puny plows I've had in this savegame for many many real life days of playing. My plan is to get at least pair of Big Bud's working together, we'll see how manageable it is to have three or four, for those huge fields I'm sure its fine but medium or small sizes the huge vehicles just get into each others way I believe. But yeah ploughing anything over 50 hectares using few SPSL 9's pulled with Big Buds... oh my, that is sweet farming porno right there <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I was surprised to see truck trailers with dolly ea and another trailer working OK with courseplay, the truck moves one trailer worth forward when the first one is full, when second is full well obviously truck continues the course. Great stuff.
</p>

<p>
1905 finished harvesting F45<br>
1913 started seeding soybeans on F10<br>
1922 finished seeding F10<br>
2109 finished harvesting F11
</p>

<p>
Now the farm got 1.691 million liters of soybeans in the silos hehe. Have to wait for market prices to get better as its on red listing $3,777 now. I'm going to load that stuff to the train in preparation for the price to be right for sell.
</p>

<p>
2207 took train full of 1.647 million liters of soybeans to maplefield mills sellpoint to wait for market prices to increase.
</p>

<p>
With my 143k liters per train car edit that is how much the train holds now, or close to it.
</p>

<p>
2235 started fertilizing F34<br>
2240 started fertilizing F09<br>
2249 noticed that soybeans price is already $4,400 and is increasing rapidly, whee! I'm like a kid in a candy store when I get that money! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
2316 finished fertilizing F09<br>
2337 started fertilizing F50<br>
2354 finished fertilizing F34, but had to abort courseplay as the stupid sp.400fs were just circling around like dogs sniffing their butts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>
2357 started fertilizing F44
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-20T0000</b> I actually shut FS17 down as it had been running since 0910hrs and seemed like courseplay had some hiccup with the sp.400fs circling. oh and the 0000hrs is not a joke, it just happend to be exactly at that time heh.<br>
