	<h2>Mods Pending Testing</h2>

<p>
Back to <a href="mods.php">Mods Main Page</a>. Post a message to <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22942" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum "PMC Farming website farming-simulator.org" topic</a> about mods that need testing. Unfortunately at fall of 2024 I don't even have FS17 installed anymore and FS25 being only three or so weeks away I highly doubt I'm ever going to go back testing mods for FS17. But I do want to have my untested mods listed in this page instead of those regular mod pages.

2024-10-22T01:50:41Z These are the FS17 terrains I have downloaded many many years ago, some are simply these page text entries and for some I still have the release ZIP files stored in some hard disk drive. If you are trying to find a terrain mod listed here but cannot find working download link anywhere else, contact me on the above PMC Tactical Forum topic and I'll see what can be done.

<p>
v1.0 by Redi90. From modDesc: Forgotten valley. The forgotten valley
<br><br>
Your grandpa has left your court to you. Because of his age, he simply did not manage to manage all the fields. That is why he has sold his fields gradually to two fields and a meadow.
<br><br>
Now it is up to you to let his farm blossom again and to realize his dream of sustainable agriculture. 2 tracktoren, 1 thresher and smaller attachments Still left, with which you can but already a beginning. So get up and live the dream of your grandfather.
<br><br>
The map is suitable for small to medium sized machines as well as for singleplayer as well as for 2-3 people. You are expecting all LS17 standarts - except for the moveable train, which is on such a smaller map is superfluous.

Judging by the modDesc.xml alone without seeing this in-game, looks like some newbie wanted to make a terrain but had no clue what to do. As you can see release file name is for "Horsh" but moddesc clearly says its agrovation (upper case I might add) and the german language version still had the SampleMap texts in place.

<h2>SouthDakota.zip</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by JamieFeterl. From modDesc: EastRiver-WestRiver, SouthDakota V1.1. Two very dissimilar regions... One state... Divided by the Missourii River... Put simply, this is a confusing, huge map. People not familiar with my maps might need to consult the manual.  There is not enough room here to explain it all, but if you know how to properly use the PDA, the chart below,  the road signs, and common sense, you should be fine. You start owning four state of the art farms, a large dairy, chicken complex, hog confinement, and a sheep ranch. Farm your 4000+ acres, do jobs outside the farm for extra cash, and buy out the smaller farms since they are retiring.

<p>
v2.0 by Blueweb. From modDesc: Mills County. Mills County map for FS17. Welcome to Mills County. You initially own 3 fields near a small farm. There are 10 fully functional farms with their own storage to play on. They range from very small to very large (buildings available and grain storage). All bin systems are expandable and many of the farms have seed/fertilizer/lime storage that need to be replenished. These are the Meridian bins are some of the farms. Your options for crops are the default ones plus millet (sorghum), oats, and rye. The Mills Coop and CPS provide provisions for seed, fertlizer, and lime sales.  Most of the farms also have a vehicle shop trigger in their sheds to allow for vehicle customization. This is especially useful when playing with Seasons mod as there is a maintenance requirement which can only be accessed at this trigger. Included are working pneumatic lifts. There are a few sell points around the map that accept various crop types.There is also a large dairy farm, hog farm (with manual ventilation), and sheep farm. All important points should be marked on the PDA. This map is made to play with Seasons mod. When using this mod, the trees and ground foliage will change dependant on the season and temperature. There is a snowmask in effect on road and in buildings (sheds are safe storage points for bales). The climate is customized for the midwest United States, so you will experience warm summers and cold winters. Please see the Seasons mod help text in game for all the changes and requirements...there are many!

RDAllen mentioned mills county has few troubles and even more troubles with courseplay, hmm.

v1.0 by Regularguy. From modDesc: oklahoma. This is the sample mod map 1. OklahomaRevised.
</p>

<p>
Note: modDesc german language states "oklahomav1" heh. Also as you can see modDesc still has samplemap text so, there is that. This size is 1.7gb with huge amounts of mods used for factories / production, with such terrains there is always the fear of bloated savegame files which cause performance issues, hopefully its not the case with this one (difficult to find out as it requires extensive testing). Apparently is 4km terrain and has 51 fields.

v1.0 by Richard - NLD Farmers. From modDesc: Oregon Springs 17. Welcome to Oregon Springs. The base of the map is made from Google Earth and changed a bit to make it more enjoyable for the game. This is my first American styled map and originally built for Farming Simulator 15, but it was released in the last 2 weeks before Farming simulator 17 came out. So i decided to bring the map to Farming Simulator 17, i hope you all enjoy the map and feel free to give me some feedback to improve the map. All the base functions from the game are in the map, the only thing is there is only 1 field where you can use the missions system and this is field 5. This is because of the shapes of the fields. This version is for PC only because of the script. I would like to thank all the modders for there objects that i used, and the people in our team for testing the map. The map has all the base fs17 functions. Custom crops with new textures, Multi Terrain Angle added, Changed environment.xml and Chopped Straw is added. There are 3 different farms for the animals. 4 crops selling points. 2 Contractor areas and one of them has an extra storage for crops. Biogas. gardencenter. chicken farm where you can sell grass, hay and straw. Sawmill and on the same terrain you can sell your wood chips. Live stock market. Vehicle shop. And next to the ''trainstation'' you can sell your logs and wood.
<br>
Welcome in Oregon Springs! Here you can be the farmer that you always wanted to be. Harvest all the fields or take care of the animals, and if you need a break go out to the forest and be a lumberjack.
</p>

<p>
Oregon Springs (from someones twitch stream) doesn't look like 4km one or any way capable of big bud. Also it has spring colored trees here and there which look like crap.
