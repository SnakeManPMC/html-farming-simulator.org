	<h2>Farming Stories</h2>

<p>
These are various stories of game plays we had with Farming Simulator 17 (FS17). Time stamps I use here are UTC.
</p>

<p>
How I purchased <a href="stories-north-west-texas-all-fields.php">North West Texas All The Fields</a> and seeded them.

	<h2>Parkers Prairie All The Fields</h2>

<p>
PMCTODO I can't remember the specifics now as it was so many months back, but I believe I used money cheat and purchased all the fields at start of this savegame, then I ploughed, seeded and harvested all the fields. This was summer of 2018.
</p>

<p>
Goal is simple; purchase, plough, fertilize, seed and harvest every field in Newlin Texas terrain. This is that <a href="stories-newlin-texas-all-fields.php">Newlin Texas All The Fields</a> story.

	<h2>Cornbelt All The Fields</h2>

<p>
Idea was to buy (money cheat) and plough all fields, seed too if possible but it was not the requirement to accomplish one field task, basically I went after the RED color on the map.

	<h2>Cornbelt From Scratch</h2>

<p>
Cornbelt starting from scratch gaming idea
</p>

<p>
2018-10-04 We all know that the money and vehicle cost system is bullshit as they cost so much per day and getting more expensive each day that eventually you run into hundreds of thousands of vehicle costs, yes I have not forgotten that ...
</p>

<p>
However I had an idea to try Cornbelt terrain "start from scratch", edit the map to remove all owned fields, then create a savegame where you sell all your equipment, reset loan and money to zero, then start doing missions to earn money until you can finally purchase your first own field. Then the ultimate goal would be to earn money by harvesting your field and eventually get to purchase and harvest ALL the fields.
</p>

<p>
Yeah quite ambitious idea indeed heh, I'm thinking the bullshit vehicle cost money system doesn't work, but would be worth to try at least... how far I get before I lose patience for a bullshit game play.
</p>

<p>
Today when I'm getting real close of having plowed all the fields by using money cheat and best equipment, I sort of need a new challenge. Once I'm done plowing all the fields, then there really is not much else to do, well sure I could do animals and logging but dunno...
</p>

<p>
Note about the money, I started easy level and sold all the vehicles which amounts to 4,013,765 USD. Then I used the one billion money cheat and started to buy vehicle and fields, once I was really close to getting all the fields but didnt have other vehicles than the plough and seed stuff, my money was already down to 670 million so I had used around 330 million which mostly went to the fields. So yeah you are definitely looking a huge ordeal to play it without money cheat and to endure that bullshit vehicle cost crap. This game play style project would definitely not be completed until FS19 is released even if you play every day hehe.
</p>

<p>
So the idea is to get a clean start from scratch savegame without any vehicles, any loan, any money, any fields and any grains in the silos. I then must start doing missions until I get enough money to purchase my first field and then the vehicles.
</p>

<p>
For missions I'm not using GPS or Courseplay (let alone the courseplay cheat), until I've purchased my own vehicles and fields. The beginning missions will be manual hands on steering wheel action. Kind of like getting back to the roots <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to record videos when doing this and uploading them to youtube on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKt0kt4BAeflHaQj4eML9cu0G4wo9Hz1j" target="_blank">PMC FS17 Playlist</a>. So no copyrighted music or twitch live streams on the background.
</p>

<p>
Vehicles and equipment for working on your first own field:
</p>
<ul>
<li>plough salford 4204, 85hp, $13,000</li>
<li>cultivator kverneland qualidisc farmer 3000, 90hp, $8,800</li>
<li>fertilizer amazone uf 1201, $24,000</li>
<li>fertilizer extra tank amazone ft 1001, $5,500</li>
<li>seeder great plains 3P1006NT, 100hp, $15,000</li>
<li>trailer metaltech db 8, $9,400</li>
<li>tractor steyr multi, engine 4115, 114hp, $89,500</li>
<li>harvester sampo rosenlew, $124,000</li>
<li>header sampo rosenlew c6 14ft, $21,000</li>
</ul>
<p>
===<br>
$310,200
</p>

<p>
Then fertilizer liquid and seed placeables.
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-06T0224</b> started a new easy level save game, sold all vehicles, paid off loan and saved, then edited savegame dir files to remove my money, grain in silos and owned fields.<br>
0406 finished 1st mission, harvesting F63, got $201,000 its a start <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0408 started 2nd mission, fertilizing F65<br>
0427 finished 2nd mission, got around $28k<br>
0457 started and finished 3rd mission on tiny F10, it was quick one and got only $2,500<br>
0500 started to fertilize 4th mission on F61.<br>
0520 finished 4th mission and got about $28k, budget now $262k<br>
0521 started to harvest 5th mission on F60<br>
0636 finished 5th mission and got about $80+33k, budget now $376k<br>
0638 started to slurry fertilize 6th mission on F63<br>
0659 finished 6th mission and got about $31+16k, budget now $424k<br>
0758 started to seed 7th mission on F55, but I had to go to the toilet and let GPS run, it ran me off the field and mission failed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>
0837 started to fertilize 7th mission on F08<br>
0859 finished 7th mission and got about $22+9k, budget now $455k<br>
0904 purchased F10 for $110,278<br>
0906 purchased steyr multi 4115, metaltech db 8 and sampo rosenlew with c6 14ft header<br>
0933 purchased plough salford 4204, cultivator kverneland qualidisc farmer 3000, fertilizer amazone uf 1201, amazone ft 1001 and great plains 3P1006NT, budget now $35k<br>
? started to harvest F10 but was so excited forgot to write it down haha. took one trailer full of wheat to HQ silos<br>
1147 purchased metaltech db 8<br>
1229 finished fertilizing F10, again forgot to write start down heh<br>
1235 started to plow F10. it was pure hell using that salford 4202 2m plow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1404 finished plowing F10<br>
1415 started cultivating F10<br>
1436 had to call it a night, was falling a sleep in front of PMC Gaming. I left it running as youtube uploads were still ongoing.<br>
2240 woke up and courseplay cultivating was finished for F10 and it was night time in-game hehe <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
2345 purchased front weight AGCO 650 to tractor as pulling the seeder was difficult to steer<br>
2346 refilled seeds and money dropped to about $5k, didnt have enough to purchase fertilizer placeable<br>
2350 started to seed soybeans F10 (again forgot to write down, but it was approx just before midnight. I'm too excited to play hehe).
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-07T0120</b> finished seeding F10, my first own field seeding is done! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0145 sold two trailer loads of wheat in SE sellpoint for about 2x $14k, budget now $32k<br>
0210 started to fertilize F10<br>
0226 topped off fertilizer tanks at the shop<br>
0239 finished fertilizing F10, now we again wait for crops to grow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0300 installed 5.3.25 version of courseplay and purchased solid fertilizer placeable to the shop<br>
0355 soybeans crop has fully grown on F10, starting harvest! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0527 forgot to write down when harvest finished, as I quickly sent tractor with trailers to empty them in HQ<br>
0550 started cultivating F10<br>
0651 used train to haul a bit wheat and 29k liters of soybeans to SE sell point, budget now $147k<br>
0704 finished cultivating F10<br>
0714 started seeding soybeans to F10<br>
0838 finished seeding F10
</p>

<p>
At this point its been a little boring as there is so much waiting going on when working with so few vehicles and only one field without any money so I cant do anything else, at all. But its been okay, I'm fully enjoying myself and being excited about developing my farm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
All I can say is enjoy the peace and quiet, while you can ... because once you get the fleet of Big Bud's kicking some ass on the 10+ fields, there is no rest for you at that point hehe.
</p>

<p>
0858 started to harvest soybeans from F10
</p>

<p>
A LOT of free time at this point when courseplay if running combine or tractor, seeing the tractor go 43km/h or combine using 3m header is funny to say the least. Using these kind of vehicles makes you really appreciate the monster stuff you can buy with unlimited money like cr 10.90 harvester, brent 1596 auger wagon and big bud tractors with seed hawk setups... man that is different world compared to this smallest starter kit heh.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking that any good new terrains get released I'll try this start from scratch method and farming simulator 19 does include such feature by default so I'm definitely going to do more of these as its so exciting to develop your farm from scratch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1008 finished soybean harvest on F10<br>
1024 sold 27k liters of soybean using the train, got $106k out of them, budget now $249k<br>
1026 started fertilizing F10<br>
1115 finished fertilizing and started cultivating, again forgot to write time down.
</p>

<p>
It really starts to get a bit boring at this stage, this is now the third harvest for this little 3 hectare field and I'm still looking at least two if not three harvests before I can purchase my second field which would add much to my activity.
</p>

<p>
1215 finished cultivating F10<br>
1219 started fertilizing F10<br>
1235 finished fertilizing F10<br>
1244 started seeding soybeans to F10<br>
1419 finished seeding F10<br>
1437 started harvesting soybeans F10<br>
1454 was dead tired and had to go to sleep ...<br>
2105 woke up and right back into harvesting soybeans in F10 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Even after a good nights sleep the task at hand seems quite overwhelming, I'm looking at ploughing again after this harvest and then the same usual routine of cultivating and seeding and harvesting before getting to see how much money I get from the next harvest.
</p>

<p>
I knew the job wasnt easy when I took it, but man... I'm really getting bored hammering this ONE field for the 4th harvest already...
</p>

<p>
Also it doesn't help that I'm recording youtube video series out of this and therefore cannot play copyrighted music or could I listen to some other youtube videos or twitch streams on the background to keep me entertained. I know it gets easy when I get one more fields and things really start to pickup after that, but its a long road it seems.
</p>

<p>
Hell I should have just done more missions, I mean if you spend one DAY doing missions you could rack up millions, but no... I had to get my OWN field hehe.
</p>

<p>
2204 finished soybean harvest F10, yield was pretty good this time, just over two full loads with metaltech db 8's (30,600 liters)<br>
2211 dropped off 16k liters of soybeans to the farm
</p>

<p>
Checked market prices, seems if I sold all 30k liters now I would get mere $115k which is not nearly enough to buy me the next field... man this is starting to get really old <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I quickly calculated that the field 45 costs $542k and I have now $243k so I need to do fucking THREE HARVESTS more to get that cash together, unless the market prices would suddenly go up a great deal but even if they did the difference aint that much, at best I could maybe manage it with two harvests then (maybe).
</p>

<p>
I am seriously losing patience and thinking about doing some missions which pay so much more, I mean what the fuck if I stare at the screen for two or so hours doing some task and then getting over two hundred thousand as reward...

<p>
I'm not giving up but these three harvests just feel like am I really going to waste today doing these, is my real life time so low cost that I'm willing to sit here and go through all that shit to buy the next field. I mean its so crazy to think that I could have that field if I EDITED ONE LINE IN ECONOMY.XML file hehe, but yeah, why not edit all the lines to get all the fields, oh wait, I already purchased AND ploughed all the fields on the other savegame... haha, sigh? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

<p>
oh man I am happy now that I got some progress, great to have another field and more to do (yeah like 6hrs plow session HAHA). The boredom waiting for an damn hour for cultivating or plowing F10 was starting to test my patience, but now I hope that things start to really pick up with second field and especially after I get the harvest from the second field then I start to see some good money too <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
Was planning on small equipment upgrade due plowing and cultivating taking so long time that seeder which could skip those phases would be real benefit for my real life gaming time. Was looking at vaderstad rapid a 600s which width is 6 meter, 180hp, price $52k. There are of course better ones but those prices start to skyrocket or the horsepower required to pull them that it will be several harvests later that I can even consider such things.
</p>

<p>
As for tractor the valtra n series with engine upgrade N174 and wide tires would have 185hp and cost $139k, so both combined $191k hmm.
</p>

<p>
For harvester the case ih 1660 axial-flow has 6340 liter tank and piece of shit 4.3 meter header, hmph, that is no upgrade because now I have 4200 liter tank with 4 meter header, the bigger tank makes no difference in harvesting time. Again any larger harvester the price will skyrocket so heh.
</p>

<p>
All I can say is beggars can't be choosers, heh. Damn its hard life being newbie farmer without cash <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
It was getting late for me in real life time, been up for like 16.5hrs, was thinking that this is pretty crazy to play FS17 so much, not only so much but using these newbie piece of shit equipment that one harvesting takes 4h 30min and plowing takes damn 6hrs. Its insane to play like this, I gotta stop or get better equipment.
</p>

<p>
Luckily now I have already 157k liters of soybeans and with the latest price it mounts up to damn $629k so I'm pretty good for tomorrows play time, I can purchase that better tractor and seeder and who knows maybe even better harvester or at least second one so the next harvest goes quicker.
</p>

<p>
As I said earlier, it ain't no fun to be a newbie farmer without cash heh.

<p>
Turns out that massey ferguson MF7700 with Horsch Pronto 9 DC was a great investment, this setup width is 9 meters and goes 19km/h which is great speed. Get another one of these and you'll do even larger fields like this. I am definitely going to get another seeder setup.

0921 purchased my third field! field number 44 for $873k, budget now $74k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not sure if it was best business decision to purchase a new field when my budget dropped so low, maybe better equipment to run the two existing fields might have been more profitable on immediate days who knows. Oh well, the goal of this game play is to purchase all the fields and thats what I'm doing heh.
</p>

<p>
0932 started to plow F44, with two tractors on those puny 2m salford 4202 ploughs, courseplay timer shows like 3h 30min heh.
</p>

<p>
I cooked food while the plowing was going on, kept thinking that man these plowings with these beginner ploughs take so long time that this might be my last using salford 4202, I mean its crazy to spend 3-6hrs just ploughing. Now with these three fields and two right next to each other I'm going to make some good money and purchase better plough setup so I can get rid of this beginner equipment finally.
</p>

<p>
I cut my hair, shaved and took a shower while plowing was going on heh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Unless you are talking about some rare falling a sleep in front of the computer thing so you go take a nap, I would consider it almost cheating if you leave courseplay running overnight while you sleep. I have done it few times for 2-3hrs naps and just recently I left computer running overnight because youtube uploads were ongoing so I couldn't really shut it down, but those are the only reasons. Also going to watch tv and turning off computer monitor while courseplay is doing its thing is considered cheating in my opinion, you must PLAY in front of the computer to... well properly play.

Currently I'm running crop growth on slow because got my third field, hopefully I can keep this setting, hopefully fertilizing has enough time to finish for all the fields, right now 45 and 44 has in first growth stage and 10 has not switched yet.

<p>
Since I purchased F44 my budget dropped down to below hundred grand and even though I have not spent any money to buy anything equipment wise, just the vehicle maintenance upkeep, seed and both solid and liquid fertilizer costs had brought the budget down to $26k. I have over 200k liters of soybeans in farm silo so assets is not an issue in that sense.
</p>

<p>
I want to keep buffer money for bare minimum of $100,000 from now on. There is just no reason to let your budget to drop below that, no vehicle or field purchases unless I get left with that base budget.

<p>
0425 sold three full and one less train cars of soybeans for $419k, $410k, $400k and $119k, budget now $1.3 million <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
So from now on, I won't let my budget drop to below $100k at any time for any reason what-so-ever.
</p>

<p>
I'm eyeballing my next field, there are some 1 and 1.1 million fields which I could buy near the shop town, but dunno maybe I should upgrade some vehicles and equipment first, like the already mentioned plough's or maybe replace that harvester sampo rosenlew with axial-flow 7130 so I could use courseplay for combine convoy.
</p>

<p>
Weakest link, hmm maybe that should be fixed the first. Right now plowing seems to be the weakest link as it takes forever to plough with 2m salford 4202 plow.

<p>
Decided that I'm going to buy field 9 because its right next to 10 so logistics with vehicles and equipment will be very easy, just across the road. Also if I buy it now it leaves me over hundred grand of budget which is my ongoing goal.
</p>

<p>
0804 purchased F09 for $1.191 million
</p>

<p>
Was lucky as the field was fully grown canola! Yeah it was one of those fields that was not filled to the edges, not sure whats that deal, you can plough it to such but AI farmers wont fill the field up. Courseplay shows the field to be 20 hectares even though in-game menu showed only 14.
</p>

<p>
Anyways for the future field purchases its good to play some finance timing game, do not buy fields when they have nothing growing, this way you can win a lot of money by harvesting the field.

Again with the tiny 2m salford 4202 plough's, so I was checking out what would be my plow upgrade purchase. Amazone Cayron 200 is 3m and not too expensive but my cheapo Steyr tractor don't have enough horsepower for it so if I want to use two plows its not going to happen and one 3m is less than two 2m ones. Lemken Titan 11 is 4.9m and smallest jointed/articulated plow with 240hp requirements. Salford 8312 is 6.9m and already 300hp requirement. And then we have our own work horse, the Big Bud dragged SPSL 9.

Was just thinking that this start from scratch game-play is very diciplined because you do not have the big money to buy all the normal equipment you have gotten used to. It takes a lot of patience to work with these piece of junk beginner implements like the mentioned 2m ploughs.

Getting a little bit frustrated with harvester and grain trailer setup of sampo rosenlew and steyr multi 4115 + agroliner hkd 302's as every damn time courseplay approaches harvester the tractor will get "in traffic".

1337 eleet hehe, took train of 490k liters of soybeans into maplefield mill SE sellpoint. When I started to sell my budget was $106k so it dropped quite close to my new base limit. I sold $404k + $394k + $384k + $375k + $365k + $160k, budget now $2.192 million <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I have always known that the price drops when you sell, we all do, but I was kind of surprised that even with this train method you have not enough time even to move the train forward one train car lenght when the price has already gone down. For some reason I had the impression that it drops several minutes after the sale but I guess not. When you look at first 404k the last full car was $39k less, now thats no chump change, you could buy nice small implements or even cheap vehicle with that amount already.
</p>

<p>
Anyways now I got 2.1 million DOLLAH, oh wow that is pretty cool, now I can really upgrade my vehicles and maybe this crazy 6hrs of ploughing era is finally over <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
I was going to take the canola for sell by train, but quickly realized the train with its 90k liter per car capacity is way overkill for mere 53k sell and also that the best price for canola is on guntherwhatever sell point which is right next to the maplefield mills but cant be accessed with a train, it has to be a truck.
</p>

<p>
1450 sold fliegl load of 47k liters of canola for $200k, budget now $1.296 million.
</p>

<p>
It now really felt like getting out of the newbie beginner vehicle mode when I got overloader and truck trailer to haul the grain into silo, that steyr tractor was fine at start but its not capable of much more volume.
</p>

<p>
I was eyeballing my budget and F60 but it was growing corn so decided to wait more profitable crop before buying any fields, most likely when the crop rotation goes to such I have other plans etc (or millions more money hehe).

1700 purchased KUHN pf 1500 for $8k and KUHN deltis 1302 mea3 for $30k
</p>

<p>
So I purchased Big Bud and KUHN DLC sometime last year, I've used big buds constantly but I dont recall ever using KUHN stuff, until now. Heh nick of time eh, FS19 release is about a month away and only now I break out the KUHN shizzle <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways, the amazone kit started to get a bit small, needed an upgrade.

1745 got my first auger wagon courseplay running (in this savegame, obviously) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Had huge problems getting combine convoy to work, I didn't get it to work actually on this F10 yet in darkness (not that light would magically fixed anything but still). First havester just wanted to drive circles around first waypoint and only way I got it to move was nearest waypoint... which of course was the wrong waypoint and it skipped headland parts completely, sigh. Oh well, first time trying combine convoy so lets get some practice on it.
</p>

<p>
Oh and forgot to write start/finished harvesting F10 also on the convoy mayhem.

</p>

<p>
Feeling good with this plough update, lemken titan 11 seems like a decent plough. Although I'm not a big fan of the jointed/articulated implements as they always go funky on the corners, courseplay leaves many spots to fix manually. Even driving yourself it is very difficult to cover all corners properly. Its always dilemma whether you should just leave the field as-is after courseplay fieldwork has been completed or go fix the corners yourself which can be very tedious especially with slow Big Bud on those large fields.
</p>

<p>
Anyways gotta love the upgrade from 2m to 6.9m which gives great deal quicker ploughing sessions.

Was making new farm business plans again, currently budget is $1.252 million and I have 505k liters of soybeans in my farm silo of which market price is below four thousand so I want to wait when it rises again, but buying a new field is on my mind and depending on the budget also fertilizer and seeder upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Field 46 would be really close to my farm and other fields, it costs quite a lot $2.152 million. F34 costs $2.392 million. F50 costs $2.065 million. F49 costs $1.977 million. Smaller fields around the shop are cheap, I could buy 60-62 and 65 right away. Hmm Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm looking for the next field purely has geographical thing so F34 looks right to me, next to my farm. Sure its quite expensive but I want to expand farm evenly out, for example there would be really cheap field on the SE corner but who wants to drive there and back until you split vehicles into regions hehe.
</p>

<p>
btw I'm going to call "$1.252 million" to just "$1.252m" from now on, so the abbreviations are "k" for thousand and "m" for million <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

I got sudden frustration about how damn long it takes real life time to play this savegame with these equipment. This came because I was having good time playing and realized that oh wow I have been up 13hrs straight playing.
</p>

<p>
Just earlier (well five hours ago hehe) I spoke about wanting to buy a new field to grow the farm business, but now I definitely want to upgrade and increase my vehicles and implements so the harvests roll through more quicker. Specifically I want to add more capability to fertilization spreaders as I only have single one now.
</p>

<p>
1702 purchased steyr multi 4115 with narrow tires for $90.1k, KUHN axis 40.2 m-emc-w for $24k and sb 1000 weight for $800, total $114.9k<br>

<p>
I'm happy with the new solid fertilization spreaders, these two implements were enough to cover F09 and they were also 20km/h fast, nice.
</p>

<p>
Market prices for soybeans stopped rising on maplefield mill where the train goes, gunthersomething is like $300 higher price but its truck connection and I only have that crappy 47k liter trailer not to mention gunt sell point is other side of the terrain heh. So yeah I'm just going to take my soybeans with the train, I want some budget to buy some field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1758 took a train to maplefield mill to sell 533k liters of soybeans, market price was at $3897. Sold $350k + $341k + $331k + $322k + $312k + $281k, budget now $2.644m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Market price dropped to $3,279 btw. I feel now I'll start to play the market finance game and not sell when I need money but only when the price is right. I once saw the soybeans price as high as $5k so maybe thats too much to ask but at least I would not sell below $4k. There is no point of giving out results of your hard work for free, we need to keep some standard of cost heh.
</p>

<p>
1808 purchased field 34 for $2.392m, budget now $251k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm maybe now I'll work hard and get budget to one million and once I reach that, then its going to be my new base buffer money, never to let budget drop below million. We'll see heh.
</p>

<p>
And damnit! in my field buying excitement I completely forgot the new tip that I should wait until the field I'm buying is actually seeded, heh oh well.
</p>

<p>
Okay, now back to work, we have new field to fertilize and plow, for starters <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
I think its time to go shopping! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the train selling, the price rises back up very soon after you sell that huge load, so maybe I should fill a train with expensive crops drive it to the sell point sell one car and then just wait until the price increases again, I mean the train is just a free storage place so why not. I mean there is no rule or any specific point of selling everything at once, especially trying to sell it quickly makes no difference as the price drops before you manage to move the train one car forward.
</p>

<p>
Having that $2.9m in my bank made me anxious to go Shopping! hehe, but was taking it easy trying to think whats the best course of action. Should I stay with these fields and just upgrade my equipment or buy new field and perhaps one or two equipment upgrades (depending on budget), dunno.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on that though more deeper, this from scratch game-play style is extremely long winded and hard work, I mean look at how many real life hours and days I have played already and while I do have basic vehicles and equipment with few fields... I still consider my assets being puny punk ass stuff compared to the unlimited money big bud MONSTA shizzle hehe.
</p>

<p>
Some math wizard should make correct table of the balance between number of fields / hectares and vehicles / implements, what is the perfect formula to quickest harvests. Obvious thing is that if one task takes more than one hour to complete, yeah you don't need to have many of those in a day and the day goes by in no time.
</p>

<p>
Anyways back to real world stuff... I was thinking of buying field 50 and enlarge is over the grassfield south of it. I guess that grass field might be nice to have, but its not like this terrain lacks grass so why not make big bucks soybean factory outta fifty hehe.

F34 is 29 hectares which doesn't sound too large but you can clearly tell that wow it is much bigger than my other fields or the standards I've been used to in this from scratch savegame. After I pull this harvest from all the fields, I'm definitely going to upgrade my vehicle and implements fleet to really speed up harvests.

</p>

<p>
New day of farming has begun. Got the F34 harvest finished last night and now I got over 600k liters of soybeans in farm silo but cannot sell them yet as market prices are really bad. I'm eyeballing that field 50 and noticed there is either odd behavior in the game itself or cornbelt terrain is buggy as the field almost like flickers on/off as growing and cultivated, I only noticed that as I'm trying to buy the field when its growing. For example I see it on the mapview as growing but once I get to the field... its empty, kind of looks seeded, then I check map again and its cultivated, like err huh? heh

0904 purchased F50, finally after pondering it for so long (kinda), for $2.065m, budget now $450k<br>
0906 started plowing F50
</p>

<p>
I decided to trust courseplay and the AI drivers to plow enlarge F50. First I drove the field edge myself, then generated course from it for two tools (lemken titan 11 pulled with fendt 700) and activated plough past field edge which should then enlarge the field. I'm ploughing over the dirt road and the grass field just south of F50 as there is plenty of grass to go around elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
For some reason ploughing past field edge didn't work, I had to activate it from the F1 menu normally.

<p>
? finished fertilizing F50, new field and soybeans market price excitement, sigh<br>
1426 started seeding soybeans on F50<br>
1449 took train of 718k liters of soybeans to maplefield mill, sold $483k but decided to wait as the price dropped and continued to climb again.
</p>

<p>
When I sold that train car 90k liter of soybeans the market price was $5,375 which was crazy. So now I'm waiting until the price climbs again and then I sell some more. There is a risk that what if it drops and keeps dropping, maybe even back to the low $2.5k or something. Well yeah there is that risk...
</p>

<p>
I have to say that I like more of the massive BOOM hammer drop sale where I sell everything as quickly as possible, but hopefully I can get more price for the crops by juggling with the market prices like this. Interesting to see how many times the price bounces back up before really starting to come down. If this method works then obviously I'm going to use it in the future, but if it doesn't... well then I keep using the massive one time sell method.
</p>

<p>
1454 sold another train car 90k liter of soybeans $483k<br>
1459 sold another set but something acted up and the unloading interrupted like three times, but I assume I got the whole car sold<br>
1503 sold another $483k<br>
1513 sold another $483k (did I sell one in between here, got confused as I had to go untangle courseplay auger wagon too hehe)<br>
1517 sold another $483k<br>
1521 sold another $474k which was the last car and that was not full, budget now $4.158m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
That was awesome as market price kept bouncing back up! hehe. While I was selling the truck trailer kept dumping soybeans from F09 and ended up having 188k liters, so as the price is still high I'm racing back to farm with the train and pickup everything that is on the silo as you cant pass by such $5.3k per thousand liter opportunity <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
Too bad I didn't have more soybeans heh, like close to a million liters ain't enough haha.
</p>

<p>
One important change I'm going to make into Cornbelt terrain config files is to increase the train car capacity from 90k to 143k liters because realistically thats much grain train cars can carry. It is not a cheat just to be clear on that, sure its kind of crossing the barrier when starting to edit a terrain but its overall good and realistic edit, very transparent to the other functionality so its all good.

1022 soybeans market price started to drop, I frantically started to load train for sale...
</p>

<p>
So yeah market price started to drop just as I was harvesting last row of F34 after which I already intended to go sell soybeans. Now I'm in rush to get train loaded and driven over there before the price drops too much. I'm thinking that because the price is dropping, now I'm not going to be able to play any financial market game so when I get there, I just start to sell, Sell, SELL.
</p>

<p>
1030 train sold $761k + $736k + $712k + $687k + $510k, budget now $4.170m
</p>

<p>
I didn't have time to see how much the price dropped while I drove train there, but quick calculation shows that first car sell was with $5,321 and seeing the last full car being only $4,804 so yeah there was definite market price drop going on. I'm just glad to manage sell as quickly as I could now.
</p>

<p>
Can't wait for the next time price skyrockets on soybeans, then I'll be ready with one million liter train load hehe.
</p>

<p>
1030 finished harvesting F34<br>
1058 started fertilizing F34<br>
1108 took train with 66k liters of soybeans to maplefield mills SE sellpoint for $340k, budget now $4.511m
</p>

<p>
That small tiny 66k liters was just to clear my silo and complete the transactions heh, still the price was over $5k so always worth to sell stuff with that kind of prices.
</p>

<p>
1155 finished plowing F44, yeah forgot to write down starting time. I wonder why do I have a such an hurry that I cant keep proper log? Hmm, good question...<br>

</p>

<p>
Field 11 is oddly done by the terrain developer as only a small square of otherwise a very large field is registered with the game. The registered square is 48 hectares and I bet the surrounding non-registered area is probably 20 hectares heh. So I'm thinking business wise should I buy more vehicles or this field as it is also fully grown wheat, so I could get the money from that harvest as well. After thinking and marveling the size and location of the field, I decided to buy it.
</p>

<p>

1616 finished seeding F34
</p>

<p>
When I was harvesting F11 I checked the actual size using courseplay and I bursted out laughing as it was 99.98 hectares, whoah yeah a bit over "20" then hehe. Also getting over 400k liters wheat harvest from this "for free" as well, currently price is $1905 so it will bring down the field price roughly $750k heh nice.

<b>2018-10-18T0609</b> back at PMC Gaming, new farming day has started <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>

</p>

<p>
Yesterday I bought the univeral auto loader truck trailer so I can carry seed/fertilizer pallets, it worked out quite well, not sure if I can setup courseplay to work with that, not purchasing the pallets obviously but at least that my seeder and fertilizer vehicles could refill from the field edge and not drive down all the way to the nearest refill station placeables, this could be avoid by spamming the terrain with these placeables but heh come on now. Also I read that the refill station is more expensive than pallets so dunno what kind of saving this might give.
</p>

<p>
On the long run I can use refinery to produce seeds and fertilizer, so hopefully once that tool pipeline is running my refill station usage is over.
</p>

<p>
Today I purchased some pallets and brought them to F09 for the two seeding vehicles, had to manually refill them as my courseplay course was not tweaked enough, also I noticed that the refill radius is extremely small, not sure if its the vehicle or the pallet (or both).
</p>

<p>
Anyways all in all it feels much nicer and realistic (kinda) to haul those pallets to the fields with a flatbed truck trailer where our planters and fertilizer sprayers can refill.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Soybeans market price was again high $5,037 so decided to take what I have now and go sell, my budget is low as $273k so I want some buffer money (andBuyFieldsAndVehicles HEHE). Hopefully market price does the bounce again.
</p>

<p>
1307 finished fertilizing F45<br>
1345 took train (143k liter per car) with soybeans to maplefield mills and sold 4 x $720k + $238k, budget now $3.252m<br>
1354 finished seeding F11
</p>

<p>
Selling that crop one train car at the time worked out just like previously, price bounced up to the level it was. I started to tell at 1345hrs but sold last car like half an hour later, it takes several minutes for the price to bounce back up, just didn't want to write play by play for every train car sold.
</p>

<p>
Decided to sell the wheat what I got from F11 and the accidentally planted F45, all 709k liters of it. Maplefield mills gives $1,921 and I have no idea if that is a good price or not, it also has red down arrow so it looks like its dropping but very slowly.
</p>

<p>
1433 took train of wheat for sale $274k and waited, price started to rise again after my sale. Then sold $273k + $272k + $272k + $261k, budget now $4.607m<br>

1834 took train with soybeans for sale, sold 4 x $720k + $46k, budget now $7.458m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1904 completed selling, wow takes a while to play this market finance game.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking about that market finance game where you wait for the prices to go back up again, well obviously you don't need to sit on your hands and wait, you can do other farming tasks, but that at least for me has the risk of me losing focus and just keeping doing something else and one hour later go like "oh yeah the crop selling" heh.
</p>

<p>
What I mean is this is another kind of ... well not grind but like useless time wasting task in FS17. Now don't get me wrong I do like that the prices change, if they would be hardcoded to X or Y it would not be so nice. Anyways, maybe its me just right this moment but I feel like I'm not going to play this market finance game many more times as its just way too time consuming, I assume that once I get train full of grain (dunno how many cars it has?) and still have plenty in farm silo, then it doesn't really matter if I just mass sell whole damn train load.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, seven and a half million dollars, that is a nice sum of money to go shopping with <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1917 started harvesting F10<br>
1930 started harvesting F50<br>
1940 finished harvesting F10
</p>

<p>
While I did the quick harvest of F10 I was again pondering how should I grow my farm, $7.4m dollah in the bank and I can't decide which is the best course of action.
</p>

<p>
When I'm playing with unlimited money its so easy to buy just fields that are next to each other after done ploughing one, but now I have to consider so many factors like too many fields stretch out my vehicles too much and having some big bud's on small fields is overkill (not that I really had big bud money yet but anyways). I'm thinking about expanding to the NW corner which has nice round fields, vehicle would be easy time operating there (with the exception of that invisible barrier on the highway).
</p>

<p>
1955 started fertilizing F10<br>

2140 started fertilizing F50<br>
2147 started plowing F34
</p>

<p>
At this time I was still trying to decide what to buy with my new money, damn decision making is hard <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2220 finished fertilizing F50<br>
2258 purchased F33, it was corn, budget now $3.291m
</p>

<p>
After hard decision making what to do with my money I decided to buy the next closest field to my farm and what better timing as it was fully grown corn too. This also is field which is actually much larger than what the game registers, so I'm getting tons of hectares after I harvest that corn and plow the field.
</p>

<p>
As for the rest of my budget, I'm going to upgrade the case ih axial-flow harvesters, auger wagon with tractor and truck trailer to better ones, I'm really fed up with the axial-flow and steyr multi + pp20 wagon setup, I need some quality equipment. Oh and if my budget lasts, I'm also going to buy my first Big Bud with seed hawk setup.
</p>

<p>
2308 sold fiegl ass for $38k, truck for $78k, 3020 header for $9k, case axial-flow 7130 for $59k, another for $86k and header $13k<br>
2312 sold steyr multi for $12k and pp 20 for $20k, budget now $3.611m
</p>

<p>
So there we go, sold all my beginner farmer vehicles which I kind of used in the end as the northern vehicle set.
</p>

<p>
2340 purchased the following:<br>
- new holland 3x cr10.90 for $430k, 3x superflex draper 45 header for $62k, 3x quasar hs 16 header for $52k<br>

Budget now $969k
</p>

<p>
So yeah went crazy with that stuff, second truck with a dolly and trailer behind the trailer hehe, so 2x70k liters of capacity. My first time trying that setup, I'm not sure how auger wagon courseplay will unload there... does it understand the second trailer or not.
</p>

<p>
That damn F35 is causing problems for every direction, I have to buy it next just so I own it which makes those "you dont own this field" problems go away. So annoying to try to work on a field which clearly is yours but game is telling you its not, also planters and fertilizers waste a lot of product when courseplay runs on those areas. Its only $6.1m heh, let me count my pennies one sec ...

</p>

<p>
Man do I love Big Bud, that SPSL 9 plow which is 10.5m width just decimates those fields when you are used to these puny plows I've had in this savegame for many many real life days of playing. My plan is to get at least pair of Big Bud's working together, we'll see how manageable it is to have three or four, for those huge fields I'm sure its fine but medium or small sizes the huge vehicles just get into each others way I believe. But yeah ploughing anything over 50 hectares using few SPSL 9's pulled with Big Buds... oh my, that is sweet farming porno right there <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

I was surprised to see truck trailers with dolly ea and another trailer working OK with courseplay, the truck moves one trailer worth forward when the first one is full, when second is full well obviously truck continues the course. Great stuff.

Now the farm got 1.691 million liters of soybeans in the silos hehe. Have to wait for market prices to get better as its on red listing $3,777 now. I'm going to load that stuff to the train in preparation for the price to be right for sell.
</p>

<p>
2207 took train full of 1.647 million liters of soybeans to maplefield mills sellpoint to wait for market prices to increase.
</p>

<p>
With my 143k liters per train car edit that is how much the train holds now, or close to it.

0836 the market price for soybeans is $4,890 and rising, really exciting to see where it ends up<br>
0844 started seeding soybeans on F11<br>
0851 purchased 2x brent avalance 1596 for $236k
</p>

<p>
These two new 1596 auger wagons are to be used as seed/fertilizer tenders for Big Bud Seed Hawk, they are so perfect for it as all you need to do is to drive next to the air cart and zoc! its refilled, I love it.
</p>

<p>
0858 started seeding soybeans on F45<br>

1014 finished fertilizing F44<br>
1015 started seeding soybeans on F44
</p>

<p>
Soybeans market price stopped increasing at $4,944 so its time for me to sell. Train was already at the maplefield mills sellpoint filled with 1.647 million liters of soybeans so lets start to sell one car at the time.
</p>

<p>
1017 sold train car of soybeans for $707k, price dropped and started to increase again, so we play the market finance game once again<br>
1026 sold train car of soybeans for $707k, and going to list rest here: 7x $707k and last three cars were smaller so 3x $593k, budget now $8.363m<br>
1113 finished seeding F44
</p>

<p>
Didn't realize the last train cars which were some open ones had less capacity than the umm grain cars, maybe I missed the xml config when I edited them, need to go back and check. Or maybe I just loaded them somehow, wrong... dunno.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, nice 8 million DOLLAH, that will get me some nice toys <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not sure if I pour all that into Big Bud vehicle upgrade or should I buy the problematic buggy field 35 which causes havoc to F34 and F33, it pisses me off so much that I'll most likely buy F35 and I'm also curious to see if its such a bug. The field costs $6.1m so I still have plenty of left for some big bud love.
</p>

<p>
1212 finished seeding F11
</p>

<p>
I'm looking at field 35 and its a 86 hectares which is fairly large but at the moment there is nothing growing there, the price will come down a lot when the AI farmer plants something there after which I buy the field and harvest the crops. Although sometimes you have to wait a while before AI plants which is odd (happened with F50 I think).
</p>

<p>
1223 purchased 2x tech tanker multi tanker with trailer hitch and wide tires for $56.3k and dolly ea with wide tires for $9.2k, budget now $8.241m<br>

1355 fertilizing fixing for F34 because the courseplay hiccup with circling vehicles previously. I was completely blind just using GPS because it was on last growth stage so I could not see the soil heh<br>
1406 I should have know, growth stage changed for ready to harvest just when I was fertilizing it hehe, HOWEVER still half of the damn field was NOT ready, sigh.<br>

Was quite frantic harvest again as I was checking out the market prices for soybeans and they still were $4,944 so I started to load the train. Harvest completed and I was keeping my eye on the prices while the last truck was traveling to farm silos.
</p>

<p>
1640 had train loaded with 920k of soybeans, off to sell them.<br>

Started Big Bud SPSL 9 three tool ploughing setup heh, nice <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1935 started fertilizing F44<br>
1938 changed crop growth rate to SLOW and I intend to keep it there, its just so much easier to get used to it and hopefully not have half grown fields etc.<br>
2004 finished fertilizing F44<br>
2005 started fertilizing F45<br>
2024 finished fertilizing F45<br>
2039 finished plowing F50, well courseplay part, still need to fix those edges
</p>

<p>
Hmm I noticed that as the terrain was a bit elevated, the SPSL 9 plow made a little bit of mess, quite few small streaks here and there, not too bad when you think about the mass volume these guys actually ploughed for me.
</p>

<p>
2107 plow fix for F50 done<br>
2107 started fertilizing F50, testing new Big Bud Brute 425/100 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
2122 started plowing F35
</p>

<p>
Even with three Big Bud SPSL 9 ploughs it says to take 2h 15min, damn... we need more plough powa! heh
</p>

<p>
2138 started seeding soybeans on F34<br>
2200 finished fertilizing F50<br>
2213 drove the big bud brute 425/100's back to shop and sold, they sound horrible I just cant use vehicles like this.
</p>

<p>
BTW Cornbelt is buggy with the F35 definition as once I bought it, all the problems with F33 and F34 went away. The dev has not seen this obviously because F35 is owned by player and therefore the bug wont show up until you edit your savegame (not Cornbelt files).
</p>

<p>
This was actually the first time I got... well not bored but kind of, frustrated I guess, dunno really. I was disappointed about the brute being so bad sounding and also when I ran three big bud plough and massey ferguson seeding courseplays I got the performance loss where FPS dropped from 60 to like below 25 at worst situations. No I'm not going to stop but just wanted to mention that after all these days for playing non-stop minimum of 16hrs / day I had nothing but 110% enthusiasm and motivation, but right now I wouldn't shed much tears if I stopped. Or something.
</p>

<p>
That performance loss is really a bad thing, I mean when you've gotten used to 60fps, how can you play when it dips to low 20's? You can't.
</p>

<p>
2310 finished seeding F34<br>
2348 finished plowing F35
</p>

<p>
It was odd as it started to rain in-game and visibility was very poor, heh kind of reflected on my mood <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now after finishing plowing F35 I actually felt like taking a break when even thinking about starting to fix those plough edge missed spots... and I did, gotta take a small breather and watch some TV, check discord which I've ignored for week+ etc. Although I had youtube video upload going for more than an hour so couldn't shut down the computer.
</p>

<p>
So I spent rest of the evening of watching TV and catching up rss news / discord chat a bit, guys were already worried what happened to me as I disappeared for almost two weeks hehe.

</p>

<p>
There is a huge logistics problem harvesting F11, three cr10.90's put out so much soybeans that the one auger wagon and truck can't keep up with them. I'm running the 70k liter truck trailer into farm HQ which is a long way, the courseplay route has been recorded with 68km/h speeds so that also slows the lizard tx 415 barrelcores capability which is 82km/h I think it was. Sure I can set it to max speed but then it runs off road on corners heh. I am looking at the grain silos on both near marys farm and the shop, but I dont think either one of those distance is any shorter, hmm not sure, would have to almost time the route.
</p>

<p>
I need a new truck trailer, using dollys to attach two of the 70k liter semi-tippers which gives nice capacity for one run. Then I also need to record new courseplay course as current one puts the truck even with a one trailer into too tight spot, the course was made for the puny metaltech db 8 for crying out loud heh.
</p>

<p>
Also thinking about buying a new truck but also second auger wagon, would set them up to the other side of the field so hopefully the auger wagons with courseplay operated would not run into each other so much, slim chance of that but who knows, gotta try it.
</p>

<p>
Currently I only have $455k budget so cant buy expensive stuff, I have to drive the other auger wagon and truck trailer "from down south" into F11.
</p>

<p>
1827 started fertilizing F35<br>
1932 finished harvesting F11
</p>

<p>
When the F11 was harvested I had 1.5 million liters of soybeans again, too bad the market prices were not so good, well they were just over $4k but even though I earlier said its my bare minimum, I think the next time sell time comes it has to be over $5k heh.
</p>

<p>
And with finishing up this harvest I didn't feel like playing at the moment, just didn't have the motivation like just few days ago so I'm going to take a break again and unless I get some sudden inspiration this will be it for today.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Took a train full of soybeans to maplefield mills to be ready for sell once price hit highest, it was $4,684 with up arrow to increase but it stalled there, few moments later it actually had dropped one dollar even though it still had the up arrow. Hmm I'm not happy to see with that price, I'd like it to break $5k but we'll see what happens. Train is parked in there now and it wont cost me a thing so I can wait, my farm silo still had like 150k liters so for immediate budget problems I could take out truck trailer and sell some.
</p>

<p>
1904 finished seeding F35
</p>

<p>
Got everything planted, only F34 is on growth stage two, if you recall I set the options plant growth rate to slow so now it will take a while for stuff to grow. Sometimes this is a problem that you don't have anything to do but wait well mostly this was a problem early in the savegame, but now it is really nice breather in the far when you just wait, relax and chill while the crops grow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So I went to pick up all the crude oil and took it to marys farm petrol station.
</p>

<p>
Field 51 has potatoes and should be harvested... except that I hate potato harvesting, the harvester is incredibly slow with stupid narrow header so I assume harvesting that field takes ages. Not only that but it produces huge loads of potatoes and I have no place to store them. I do have placeable for 300k liter storage capacity but yeah dunno... it is just a drag to harvest potatoes, you should only do them on a small field which would produce more than enough for your pigs to feed.
</p>

<p>
Budget is really low after the seed and fertilize costs, only $184k right now, but train full of soybeans is sitting at maplefield mills so millions are available at any moment.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the market prices stopped at $4,681 which while is pretty nice, its not nice enough for me. I wanna $5k before I sell my hard work.
</p>

<p>
2026 was really tired which was odd feeling after all these days of playing without taking a nap, so decided to take a nap to refreshen myself up.
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-23T0016</b> woke up and back starting up FS17, farming continues after refreshing nap.<br>
0026 picked up 154k liter of crude oil from marys farm petrol station by the oil tanker train, I got now 221k liter of crude oil in refinery
</p>

<p>
There was definite lul in the action as crops were growing, most in their first stage and I only had 184k budget so could not buy any new toys while I was waiting for market prices to go up again (not satisfied with $4.6k sell price).
</p>

<p>
I would want to get animals started, sure this savegame goal is to buy all the fields so why waste time with animals, but heh animals are a big part of FS17 so yeah got to have some animals. First I need is water and grass, well I have a huge water truck tanker but no mower or forage wagon to collect that stuff. I don't want to spend my last budget of buying those, also I want to go for the expensive krone big m or whatever it was which really cuts down grass quickly.
</p>

<p>
Oh also the potato field needs to get harvested but the damn harvester costs like almost half a million dollars.
</p>

<p>
0240 started fertilizing F35<br>
0244 started harvesting F34
</p>

<p>
While harvesting F34 and things were rolling smoothly, luckily no harvester traffic accidents on the narrow northern part of the field, was thinking about purchasing a fourth harvester which actually was my plan all along, nice round number heh. So when the next batch of crops are sold, then I'll be purchasing two new holland cr10.90 harvesters and oh yeah one more semi-tipper trailer truck for the "harvesting team" that doesn't have two now. Like said, the weak link is the lack of two trucks for me on that team, the harvesters just pull in so much grain that one truck cannot keep up.

<p>
I really need to get fertilizer tender thing going, its too long journey for these tractors to drive from fields 9 through 11 into shop to refill. I gotta have brent avalance 1596 filled with solid and tech tank 40k liters of liquid fertilizer by the fields. Because I have to support Big Bud courseplay courses (ie driving at the middle of the road), the tractors also always get stuck in traffic when they go refill at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Maybe increase the steyr multi with KUHN EMC spreader setup to 4 tractors, they usually don't collide much on the field so 4 would be quite nice fast setup.

1313 back at PMC Gaming, FS17 booted up, we are back farming.<br>
1336 after time accelerating through the night (only used 960x now) market prices started to drop. I guess my dreams of millions are again further away.<br>
1346 started seeding soybeans on F34
</p>

<p>
Overnight running vehicle costs are $28k so with the latest seed/fertilizer purchases my budget is now only $71k so it dropped below the one hundred thousand base limit I set. Guess its time to send truck trailer to sell one batch of soybeans into closest sell point. No I don't want to sell anything from my "money train" which sits there waiting for good market prices heh, yeah call me weird but thats how I want to sell the train contents.
</p>

<p>
1449 finished seeding F34<br>
1548 took 70k liter truck trailer load of soybeans to gunther sell point, budget now $314k<br>
1719 took 70k liter truck trailer load of soybeans to gunther sell point, budget now $553k
</p>

<p>
With those two truck loads I can now purchase potato harvester and get to work on F51.
</p>

<p>
1724 purchased grimme tectron 415 for $429k, budget now $124k<br>
1738 started harvesting F51, potatoes
</p>

<p>
Potato harvesting is pain, you have to manually drive some sort of trailer to pick up the potatoes and drive to where you need them to go, I mean you cannot use overloader for potatoes.
</p>

<p>
F51 is huge and I know from experience and this size field will produce incredible amount of potatoes far more than I ever need heh, so I doubt I'm going to harvest all of it. Now I just started to chip away from the western edge and thinking about proceeding as much as my patience allows heh.
</p>

<p>
Seriously potato harvesting must be the most time consuming and boring work in FS17 because of the narrow header and super slow harvester plus that you cannot use auger wagon for potatoes.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to use courseplay to generate field work course for the whole field because it is massive within scale of this vehicle, so what I did was to drove myself a small box edge at the western edge of the field recording course and used that to generate field work course which must have been like 5% of the field. Then I let courseplay drive the vehicle and I drove the semi-tipper truck to unload the harvester.
</p>

<p>
1829 purchased root crop storage placeable for $90k, budget now $34k
</p>

<p>
This placeable is nice, but it only holds 300k liters which I consider to be low amount, of course you can place more of these but heh yep dunno. On the other hand I don't know how much potatoes pigs eat so maybe one storage full lasts for years in-game time who knows heh, maybe I'll find out in this savegame <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After doing the potato thing a while it was kind of, relaxing I guess (just like FS17 in general), was thinking that I'll keep chipping away this huge field every time there is some lul in the usual farming action like right now. Crops are growing and they still take a while to get to harvest stage and without money I have not much else I could do, other than going to pick up crude oil which I assume there is very little as I just picked it up.
</p>

<p>
Only thing I'm wondering is do I have to go sell another truck load of soybeans for money as I don't have enough to buy more root crops placeables...
</p>

<p>
2151 took semi-tipper 70k liter load of potatoes to gunther sell point for $92k, budget now $126k<br>
2156 purchased root crops storage placeable for $90k, budget now $36k
</p>

<p>
Whee I got another root crops placeable to store more potatoes <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was harvesting potatoes and watching MN Millennial Farmer from youtube, kind of relaxing but I did kind of wonder how damn long time does it take for next growth stage which is harvest, it felt like ages.

1504 back at PMC Gaming, starting up FS17, lets harvest...<br>
1540 soybeans market price for maplefield mills is increasing but the other sellpoints already stopped, its now on green $4,609 and increasing
</p>

<p>
I'm writing this several days since I drove the "money train" into maplefield mills to wait until the price is right so feels like ages for me. Now I already have <i>two</i> million liter of soybeans in farm silo and the biggest fields are like half way harvested and then I still have F44, F45 and F50 left to harvest heh, I'm scared to think how many liters I end up.
</p>

<p>
What that means is when the price stops increasing and hopefully its above $5k I'm starting to sell doing the market finance game, when the train is empty I race back to farm fill it up and going back to maplefield to sell some more as long as I have grain and the price is high.
</p>

<p>
If I manage to pull this off... like said I'm scared to even think how many millions I end up with heh. Exciting times <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1624 soybeans market prices unfortunately seems to have stalled to $4,672 as it takes extremely long time to increase one dollar
</p>

<p>
I'm little bit worried that the price has again stalled to this same 4.6k level, if so, then I have to sell because it was such a torture to live this one game-day without money.
</p>

<p>
1636 finished harvesting F35<br>

1712 finished harvesting F11<br>
1736 soybeans market price in maplefield mills stopped increasing at $4,700 even

Damn shame I wished over $5k... damn damn damn <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

Well also I have 2.9 million liters of soybeans in farm silo and I haven't even started harvesting F50, oh my that is some serious load of crops <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I really really hate to sell my crops with less than $5k but the price has twice now stalled to around $4.7k as its now so after the potatoes madness day+ I really do not wish to sit on my hands waiting for price to be right, I think its time to start selling and getting some PROGRESS on this field purchasing farm business.

1932 sold soybeans train car for $564k, budget now $9.252m
</p>

<p>
Immediately started train and raced to farm silos to load another 1.647 million liters of soybeans for sale before the market price plummets again
</p>

<p>
On F50 I tried six (6)! combine harvester setup... which went, excuse my language, completely to SHIT. I mean the first harvester sped off without combining and used wrong course lane, then soon after first harvesters collided and soon there after it was one big stinking mess. It was much like watching The Benny Hill Show when these harvesters were goofing around.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I think in order to run such numbers of harvesters you need to have 300+ hectare field to have the benefit and ROOM for them to maneuver, anything less and you should use less harvesters, I mean whats the point of throwing more than 4 harvesters to a 20 hectare field.

</p>

<p>
When you dump water and wheat to this location, you'll get seeds overtime. I don't know how long it takes, but I got my first 2500 liters of seeds in the time I was writing this farming log entry.
</p>

<p>
You have to pickup the seeds by train, you can't access them with truck.
</p>

<p>
0540 took another truck load of soybeans for the other side of stanton sawmill to produce fuel and compost.<br>
0601 took another truck load of wheat for making seeds. at this time I already had 25k liters of seeds done, cool!
</p>

<p>
Seems like the days of purchasing seeds are over as the factory produces so high quantity of seeds. Hopefully the fertilizer side of things works the same.

</p>

<p>
Its so painful to haul the potatoes so far to gunther for sale, so I decided to disconnect the second semi-tipper trailer, use the first 70k liter one only which makes the truck more easier / faster to drive and then I'm going to dump all the remaining potatoes at the edge of F51 where they are in nobodys way and I can access them whenever I want lateron. I can use conveyor belts to load them into trucks when the time comes.

<p>
Tried out the new bredal 20k liter spreader trailer, it was odd, courseplay complained that I need seeds for it. So I had to fake the course as normal route and slow down the speed so its not unrealistic like these losers you see in twitch streams with 21km/h speeding harvesters with 1000 meter heads etc.

After a meal and watching some welker farm youtube videos, somehow I felt... not ready to continue with F33, F35 and F50 harvests because I expected to get tired soon, had that semi tired / exhausted feeling. Hmm and only been playing 13hrs straight, thats nothing, I should have at least 3-4hrs more hours left in me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh and also I was hesitant to start harvests as weather indicator shows rain, odd thing is that its the current weather indicator, but I see no rain hmm.
</p>

<p>
0819 yeah didn't feel like continuing with the harvests so shut down FS17 for today (judging by how many hours I've been at it today), won't go to sleep yet but have to stop short today, if someone could call 13hrs straight a "short" heh. Anyways more farming tomorrow.

When it was raining I did some maintenance, refueled vehicles, refilled stanton sawmill factories, hauled seeds and fertilizer with a train etc.
</p>

<p>
2043 edited CornBelt a bit, translated few german words to english and tweaked train car woodships from 120k liters to 143k same as grain.<br>

2327 started fertilizing F46<br>
2331 purchased F60 for $934k and F61 for $1.173m, budget now $209k
</p>

<p>
Purchasing these fields was quick decision as I had the money and the fields had crops fully grown which is money in the bank. Sure I dropped below one million base budget limit but it was a good deal and I have plenty of crops to sell in my farm silo all I need to do is to haul that stuff to sell point.
</p>

<p>
Currently I'm lacking liquid transport, I have that one MAN truck which I use for fuel and multi liquid tankers, it is a lot of swapping tanker trailers when you hop from multi to fuel because often times the multi one is not empty for example at the moment of writing this multi is filled with fertilizer but this would be perfect time to go haul some crude oil, but I cant as the tankers are not empty.

<p>
Started to feel a bit not really exhausted but and I hate to use this word but, bored. Right now all but one field has been harvested, several plough tasks in front of me and still with all these millions and big buds and mumbo jumbo, I feel like I'm only 20% progress for buying all the fields, dunno maybe more but yeah the light at the end of the tunnel is so small I can barely see it hehe.
</p>

<p>
0210 finished harvesting F51 potatoes, uuh what an ordeal... no more, never again! haha <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So first I purchased those two 300k liter placeables, then I started to haul 140k truck loads to gunther and once that got old I started to dump the potatoes into back end of the field into a huge mountain of potatoes. It is clear to me that the grain (at least potatoes) pile on the ground does not even come close to the actual liter amount as the pile is super small compared to the endless truck loads I dumped there. Oh well its FS17 for you.
</p>

<p>
If I only feed the potatoes to my pigs (which I purchase soon), it will last me for two life times hehe, I highly doubt I'll be planting more potatoes in this savegame, there just is no need after this monster mountain of potatoes.

<p>
I was ploughing F15 which was in the corner of wide open landscape without anything on the horizon and I realized how good I felt to break into this north west section of this terrain which has large square fields, I think I'm going to like farming here <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Most likely I try to purchase fields in this area now before expanding elsewhere, this NW is like the mirror image of the NE which has the smallest fields of this terrain and probably the most busy area.
</p>

<p>
I just love so much of the large open areas without objects for your vehicles to collide into or lack of parking space. Now don't get me wrong I don't want an objectless flat terrain, oh no, but like the most horrendous piece of garbage you can find are these claustrophobic BRITISH terrains where I would never ever imagine myself farming.

</p>

<p>
F49 was accidentally planted with soybeans and wheat, it happened when I started courseplay courses using new seedhawk planter which was used the first time and obviously it defaults to wheat.
</p>

<p>
But this accident brought in some new information, I had two rows side by side soybeans and wheat, the wheat row would yield roughly twice as much grain than soybeans. So even as soybeans is pretty much twice more value on the market wheat still gets you a lot of money because you get so damn much of it (yield).
</p>

<p>
1022 shut down FS17 for today, quite exhausted of playing already, I think it finally starts to wear me out, heh we'll see. More farming tomorrow.

Damn 4 big bud seedhawk setups is nasty with courseplay, you have to separate them far apart when you send them on their way that they won't collide with each other. Seems like in the headland corners with seedhawk courseplay wants them to do 360 turn which takes time. In this time the trailing vehicle can catch up to him and... "is in traffic" hehe.

Been a long day, I should move the four Big Bud's down south to F33 and F35 for some heavy duty seeding, but I'm quite exhausted and don't have "energy" to drive one of them down there (and rest would come after using courseplay).
</p>

<p>
Just finishing fertilizing F11 with the old shop refill system using only two steyr multis heh. Maybe tomorrow market prices are better so I could sell some crops to get money and upgrade those spreaders.
</p>

<p>
Anyways been very nice day today, been playing almost sixteen hours now heh, very nice day indeed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1128hrs dropped to NEGATIVE budget hehe. Its now -$23k, wow how did that happen? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright lets bring the budget now above one million and then keep it there. Seems like my "but this was a good deal to buy these two fields" brought the budget to negative side, ouch. And to remind you, my budget the CASH flow might be on minus but I have millions of liters crops in farm silo so I could get millions in cash by just hauling them for sale, so its not like I'm broke heh.

<p>
2353 back at PMC Gaming, FS17 already running, lets continue farming...
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-11-02T0007</b> wasn't feeling the desire to farming, but gotta do it man. I drove first Big Bud from F16 to F33
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that at least for today I'm going to try to split up my four Big Bud's into two teams, north and south. I do have to take good care not to have them collide each other on seeding or fieldwork mode so maybe this split up makes them easier to manage. Also the traveling between north and south is just pain with these slow 32km/h monsters like I just did right now. We'll see how it feels to work with only two of them, maybe the seeding/ploughing times increase to several hours again who knows.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday while seeding I learned a lesson that never ever start seeding or fertilizing until you have refilled the vehicle seed/fertilizer tanks and seed/fertilizer tender auger wagon standing by. Otherwise you most likely will run out of products and then your vehicles are standing idle on the field while you hurry up to get auger wagon from where ever it might be. This is especially bad on seeding because long seeding times might cause first growth stage to switch on the headlands while you are still seeding.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Decided to take my 250k liters of barley for sale, it had the best price of non soybeans crops now. This was just to clear myself out of the negative budget and perhaps if it gives me enough money then buy those bredal spreaders (probably not).
</p>

<p>

0646 finished fertilizing F34<br>
0747 installed commodity prices mod so I can monitor soybean market price without going back and forth with the sluggish ESC map and price page
</p>

<p>
Now I'm kind of just waiting for market price to go up so I can sell and get some progress to this savegame.
</p>

<p>
It was 2018-10-28 in real life days when I purchased the last fields, the goal of this savegame is to purchase all the fields. So I have spent all these days, oh my had to actually double check but its been 3-4 days depending how you count them since that purchase... no new fields in four real life days of playing?
</p>

<p>
Umm what am I doing here, how does this drag for this long. I mean you have to understand that I'm playing all day every day, check the times in this "log" and you'll see... all that playing results to what? Sure I have large amount of soybeans in my farm silos but as the price kind of sucks... I'm just spinning my wheels here.
</p>

<p>
Well okay not spinning wheels as I'm working on the fields constantly, I don't just sit by idle while time goes by, I guess eventually as the soybeans market price goes up I have mega amounts of it to sell. But yeah getting a 20+ million payday after every so many days... uh man this is taking way too long.
</p>

<p>
I'm not smart enough to calculate or imagine what would the <i>long term game-play</i> difference be if I just sold ANYTIME the market price settles to a decent amount, like lets say over $4000, I mean if you sell 1.647 million liters of soybeans for $4k and then $5k its $6.588m vs $8.235m so damn $1.647m difference. One and a half million dollars go up in the smoke, poof. That is not good, why on earth would you sell your crops with such a lower price. Imagine how many vehicles could you buy with that difference, that lost money?
</p>

<p>
Currently I have 3.290 million liters of soybeans and 1.255 million liters of wheat in farm silo (plus most fields planted with canola heh), if I would sell all the soybeans as current market price is stable at $4273 it would get me mere 14,058,170 million.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in this savegame I saw the $5300 market price just ONCE and would have to scan the log up to see if I ever sold above 5k since, so who knows how many in-game days when market prices change I would have to wait for optimum prices.
</p>

<p>
Hmm dunno, just dunno man...

1022 purchased grimme sl 80-22 quantum conveyor belt for $12k
</p>

<p>
Used tractor to pull the grimme conveyor belt to stanton sawmill, there I purchased manure shop where this "filltrigger" conveyor belt works to buy manure. Yes slurry and manure placeables are borderline cheating, but it is impossible to get that many animals that they would produce enough of shit to last for a large farm.
</p>

<p>
Now I get to supply my fertilizer factory with slurry and manure so I have good supply for resources as the compost from crude oil and grain just ain't enough.
</p>

<p>
Also this manure shop will supply manure spreader implement for south west region once I buy Big Bud 450 and that bouchard 70k liter manure spreader.

<p>
I made the decision to stop playing <i>for now</i> tonight as its been exactly one month (four weeks) since I started on oct 6th. I have ignored my real life duties so much over this month that I have huge backlog of stuff to do, also on few days as you can read above I have gotten pretty frustrated / bored of playing 16hrs straight every day.
</p>

<p>
I will continue this savegame, unless farming simulator 19 which is to be released on 20th this month, is so great that I never will start up FS17 again. But for that to happen from what sneak peeks we have seen so far... it would be rather surprising. Anyways thats far too long into the future, what happens, happens.
</p>

<p>
This decision was few days in the making, I was first planning on oct 6th to nov 6th as one month even, but actually its been four weeks today ie one month so this decision today came quite quickly as I was expecting to have few more days to play. Sort of sudden feeling that uh oh am I <i>really</i> ready to let go Cornbelt from scratch so quickly hehe. But nah, its good to stop now. And hey I still have a long day ahead of me, so lets keep farming until the cows come home (or something) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0837 finished seeding F50<br>
1027 took 140k liter truck trailer of fertilizer to gunther for sale, sold $844k
</p>

<p>
Now this is really interesting issue... stanton sawmill refinery area has fertilizer factory, it uses compost or manure and slurry to produce fertilizer. Gunther sell point will buy fertilizer for very high price, on this savegame the lowest it ever was were $10.8k and highest $12k. Compost is a produced on the refinery as you put in crude oil and canola/soybeans/sunflowers, manure and slurry is produced by animals.
</p>

<p>
Now everybody who has played FS17 knows that the balance is off somehow, the animals just do not produce enough manure/slurry to cover even smaller farm. Therefore we have to use manure/slurry sell point mods. The price of manure/slurry on these mods is extremely low as it should be, I mean it is SHIT, who would pay any good money of it hehe.
</p>

<p>
So I setup a manure and slurry sell point mods into south side of stanton sawmill, added conveyor belt for the manure sell point. Then I use truck to haul that stuff into the fertilizer factory in stanton sawmill area. And now, fertilizer is produced for me.
</p>

<p>
Again to iterate that manure/slurry is extremely cheap, a 70k liter truck load of manure costs few hundred bucks, 40k liter slurry tanker costs the same. I have not tracked down how much fertilizer can be produced from one liter of each of the shit materials, but if thousand liters pays like $12,000 dollars... oh my, that is indeed quite the crazy stuff.
</p>

<p>
I do not want to cheat and this almost feels like turning your urine into champagne and shit into cocaine hehe. But I am not cheating, I am not using anykind of editing of files or exploits... this is made by the Cornbelt terrain developer as a factory and I am simply using it as intended.
</p>

<p>
But yeah I can see that over time it can mount to millions of dollars of profit when I haul the shit to the factory, train carry fertilizer to the silo and finally truck trailer to haul the fertilizer for sale in gunther sell point. So yeah, good money indeed.
</p>

<p>
One thing I am afraid is that it might be so good money that my soybeans profits feel like chump change, now that would be horrible, I don't want FS17/Cornbelt to turn into some retarded Factory Simulator, I want the farming of crops being the main focus. But time will tell what sort of money can be made with this fertilizer factory.

2227 started to sell, sold 12x $619k, budget now $28.877m.
</p>

<p>
Man what a pain selling those train cars were as you waited until the price went up again. I just kept watching FS19 live streams while doing it heh. Was done at 2359 (nice time heh).

</p>

<p>
Its funny to think that wayy wayyy back how many days ago already when I was still playing the first month marathon here, I said to wait until soybeans prices go up... and I am STILL waiting, feels like forever hehe.
</p>

<p>
0437 Was somehow super tired so went to take a nap and totally forgot to write it down, anyways woke up and started PMC Gaming back up at this timestamp.<br>
0520 started harvesting F33
</p>

<p>
Right now I'm thinking about logistics, I want a big square fields without bridges or other narrow places between them where I would have to unpack harvester headers. This means the NW corner and south of my farm. F32 is growing barley and it can be plowed to much larger than the owner is selling it for (71 hectares).
</p>

<p>
I want to place a big harvester and big bud setup into these regions so they don't have to be driven back and forth as harvester header unpacking gets old real fast and big buds are so damn slow.
</p>

<p>
Harvesting some of those smaller fields is pretty much over in this savegame, I mean what is the point of harvesting F10 which is ridiculously small when you have monster fields like F33 and F35 next to it and the new F51 which get you huge loads of grain with one go. Also the F44 and F45 combo is pretty bad because it literally is locked between two bridges.
</p>

<p>
Obviously buying big bud setup next to a every two or so fields is overkill, but the NW corner and south of farm is excellent setup locations.
</p>

<p>
0547 purchased F02 for $3.836m, F03 for $4.441m, F06 for $7.515m, F07 for $6.005m and F32 for $5.775m, total $27.572m, budget now $4.401m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
0613 started fertilizing F08<br>
0629 purchased lizard tx 415 barrelcore for $175k, 2x semi-tipper 70000/6 for $70k and dolly ea for $9k, budget now $4.074m
</p>

<p>
This tx 415 barrelcore truck is painted white, its my COCAINA truck to haul fertilizer from the SW silo to gunther sell point for that big DOLLAH <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
The SW silo has capacity of 5 million liters, I can only imagine what kind of money train it will be to get fertilizer from the factory to the silo and from the silo with a semi truck to gunther to sell. It is going to make just insane amount of money. It is borderline cheating but as I said before I am not editing any files, not exploiting any game bugs etc, this is how Cornbelt developer intended it to be, fertilizer factory in work heh.

Could not fertilize F07 as it was bought from the AI owner as-is in some weird state, happens often with AI fields. I need to really queue my field purchased and only buy them when they are seeded so I can have money from the crop and then fertilizing works without plowing first.

<b>2018-11-20T0012</b> took semi truck of fertilizer for gunther to sell, sold $816k the first 70k liter trailer, after price went back up sold another for $816k.<br>

Had to bring another truck to help as the one is way too little, I had over 1 million liters fertilizer on the SW silo and train almost full (1 million liters) and manure/slurry tanks stocked up for further fertilizer manufacturing, hehe.

Selling that truck load of fertilizer concluded this play session as Farming Simulator 19 had been downloaded, I'm going to start install and play that now. Remains to be seen if this log entry was the last for this savegame and who knows, maybe for FS17 all together... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
