	<h2>Farming Stories</h2>

<p>
These are various stories of game plays we had with Farming Simulator 17 (FS17). Time stamps I use here are UTC.
</p>

<p>
How I purchased <a href="stories-north-west-texas-all-fields.php">North West Texas All The Fields</a> and seeded them.
</p>

<p>
Goal is simple; purchase, plough, fertilize, seed and harvest every field in Newlin Texas terrain. This is that <a href="stories-newlin-texas-all-fields.php">Newlin Texas All The Fields</a> story.
</p>

<p>
Purchase <a href="stories-cornbelt-all-fields.php">Cornbelt All The Fields</a> and plough them, seed too if possible.
</p>

<p>
The one and only original <a href="stories-start-from-zero-fs17-cornbelt.php">Start From Zero FS17 Cornbelt</a> story page that started it all (see: <a href="../19/stories.php">FS19 Stories</a> and <a href="../22/stories.php">FS22 Stories</a>) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">

	<h2>Parkers Prairie All The Fields</h2>

<p>
PMCTODO I can't remember the specifics now as it was so many months back, but I believe I used money cheat and purchased all the fields at start of this savegame, then I ploughed, seeded and harvested all the fields in Parker's Prairie FS17 terrain. This was summer of 2018.
