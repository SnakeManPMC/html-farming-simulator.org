	<h2>2018-10-28 Harvest Got Rained Out</h2>

<p>
1743 back at PMC Gaming, starting up FS17, we have three big harvest to do <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1805 started harvesting F33<br>
1815 started harvesting F50<br>
1851 well now it started to rain, all harvesters stopped. I guess we wait for clear weather then...
</p>

<p>
When it was raining I did some maintenance, refueled vehicles, refilled stanton sawmill factories, hauled seeds and fertilizer with a train etc.
</p>

<p>
2043 edited CornBelt a bit, translated few german words to english and tweaked train car woodships from 120k liters to 143k same as grain.<br>
2145 plowing fixes for F46 done.<br>
2327 started fertilizing F46<br>
2331 purchased F60 for $934k and F61 for $1.173m, budget now $209k
</p>

<p>
Purchasing these fields was quick decision as I had the money and the fields had crops fully grown which is money in the bank. Sure I dropped below one million base budget limit but it was a good deal and I have plenty of crops to sell in my farm silo all I need to do is to haul that stuff to sell point.
</p>

<p>
Currently I'm lacking liquid transport, I have that one MAN truck which I use for fuel and multi liquid tankers, it is a lot of swapping tanker trailers when you hop from multi to fuel because often times the multi one is not empty for example at the moment of writing this multi is filled with fertilizer but this would be perfect time to go haul some crude oil, but I cant as the tankers are not empty.
</p>

<p>
2359 finished fertilizing F46
</p>
