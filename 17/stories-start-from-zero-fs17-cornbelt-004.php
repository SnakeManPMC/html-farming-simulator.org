	<h2>2018-10-09 Seeding And Harvesting Soybeans F10</h2>

<p>
2018-10-09T00:59:00Z New farming day has started, woke up and back to Cornbelt, plowing F45 continues <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
0103 started fertilizing F10<br>
0121 finished fertilizing F10<br>
0121 finished plowing F45<br>
0131 started seeding F10<br>
0154 purchased seed, fertilizer and liquid fertilizer placeables for HQ, budget dropped to $1,896 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>
0203 started to fertilize F45<br>
0219 took a train to sell soybeans in SE sellpoint at $127k, budget now $138k<br>
0258 finished seeding soybeans on F10<br>
0321 finished fertilizing F45<br>
0330 started seeding soybeans on F45<br>
0435 had to go refuel stayer multi #2, damn I need to refine crude oil to fuel for my farm HQ <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was planning on small equipment upgrade due plowing and cultivating taking so long time that seeder which could skip those phases would be real benefit for my real life gaming time. Was looking at vaderstad rapid a 600s which width is 6 meter, 180hp, price $52k. There are of course better ones but those prices start to skyrocket or the horsepower required to pull them that it will be several harvests later that I can even consider such things.
</p>

<p>
As for tractor the valtra n series with engine upgrade N174 and wide tires would have 185hp and cost $139k, so both combined $191k hmm.
</p>

<p>
For harvester the case ih 1660 axial-flow has 6340 liter tank and piece of shit 4.3 meter header, hmph, that is no upgrade because now I have 4200 liter tank with 4 meter header, the bigger tank makes no difference in harvesting time. Again any larger harvester the price will skyrocket so heh.
</p>

<p>
All I can say is beggars can't be choosers, heh. Damn its hard life being newbie farmer without cash <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0923 finished seeding soybeans on F45<br>
1033 started harvesting soybeans on F10<br>
1153 finished harvesting F10<br>
1207 started harvesting soybeans on F45, oh gosh courseplay timer says 4h 33min hehe! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1248 started to plow F10<br>
1435 finished plowing F10<br>
1439 started fertilizing F10<br>
1456 finished fertilizing F10<br>
1500 started to cultivate F10<br>
1520 broke 100,000 liters of soybeans in farm silo. prices of course fluctuate but maplefield mill buys now for $4012 so looking at four hundred grand <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
1607 finished cultivating F10<br>
1610 started fertilizing F10<br>
1640 finished fertilizing F10<br>
1643 started seeding soybeans on F10
</p>

<p>
It was getting late for me in real life time, been up for like 16.5hrs, was thinking that this is pretty crazy to play FS17 so much, not only so much but using these newbie piece of shit equipment that one harvesting takes 4h 30min and plowing takes damn 6hrs. Its insane to play like this, I gotta stop or get better equipment.
</p>

<p>
Luckily now I have already 157k liters of soybeans and with the latest price it mounts up to damn $629k so I'm pretty good for tomorrows play time, I can purchase that better tractor and seeder and who knows maybe even better harvester or at least second one so the next harvest goes quicker.
</p>

<p>
As I said earlier, it ain't no fun to be a newbie farmer without cash heh.
</p>

<p>
1750 finished seeding F45 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1758 was dead tired and had to call it a night...
