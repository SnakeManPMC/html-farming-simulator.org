	<h2>2018-10-07 Few More Missions</h2>

<p>
2018-10-07T21:05:00Z New farming day has started, woke up and right back into harvesting soybeans in F10 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Even after a good nights sleep the task at hand seems quite overwhelming, I'm looking at ploughing again after this harvest and then the same usual routine of cultivating and seeding and harvesting before getting to see how much money I get from the next harvest.
</p>

<p>
I knew the job wasnt easy when I took it, but man... I'm really getting bored hammering this ONE field for the 4th harvest already...
</p>

<p>
Also it doesn't help that I'm recording youtube video series out of this and therefore cannot play copyrighted music or could I listen to some other youtube videos or twitch streams on the background to keep me entertained. I know it gets easy when I get one more fields and things really start to pickup after that, but its a long road it seems.
</p>

<p>
Hell I should have just done more missions, I mean if you spend one DAY doing missions you could rack up millions, but no... I had to get my OWN field hehe.
</p>

<p>
2204 finished soybean harvest F10, yield was pretty good this time, just over two full loads with metaltech db 8's (30,600 liters)<br>
2211 dropped off 16k liters of soybeans to the farm
</p>

<p>
Checked market prices, seems if I sold all 30k liters now I would get mere $115k which is not nearly enough to buy me the next field... man this is starting to get really old <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I quickly calculated that the field 45 costs $542k and I have now $243k so I need to do fucking THREE HARVESTS more to get that cash together, unless the market prices would suddenly go up a great deal but even if they did the difference aint that much, at best I could maybe manage it with two harvests then (maybe).
</p>

<p>
I am seriously losing patience and thinking about doing some missions which pay so much more, I mean what the fuck if I stare at the screen for two or so hours doing some task and then getting over two hundred thousand as reward...
</p>

<p>
I'm not giving up but these three harvests just feel like am I really going to waste today doing these, is my real life time so low cost that I'm willing to sit here and go through all that shit to buy the next field. I mean its so crazy to think that I could have that field if I EDITED ONE LINE IN ECONOMY.XML file hehe, but yeah, why not edit all the lines to get all the fields, oh wait, I already purchased AND ploughed all the fields on the other savegame... haha, sigh? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

oh man I am happy now that I got some progress, great to have another field and more to do (yeah like 6hrs plow session HAHA). The boredom waiting for an damn hour for cultivating or plowing F10 was starting to test my patience, but now I hope that things start to really pick up with second field and especially after I get the harvest from the second field then I start to see some good money too <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
