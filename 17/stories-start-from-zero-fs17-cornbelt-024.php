	<h2>2018-10-29 Big Buds And Mumbo Jumbo</h2>

<p>
1959 back at PMC Gaming, firing up FS17, harvest continues...<br>
2009 started harvesting F11<br>
2116 started harvesting F45<br>
2206 finished harvesting F45<br>
2207 started harvesting F44<br>
2255 finished harvesting F44
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-10-30T0017</b> finished harvesting F11
</p>

<p>
Started to feel a bit not really exhausted but and I hate to use this word but, bored. Right now all but one field has been harvested, several plough tasks in front of me and still with all these millions and big buds and mumbo jumbo, I feel like I'm only 20% progress for buying all the fields, dunno maybe more but yeah the light at the end of the tunnel is so small I can barely see it hehe.
</p>

<p>
0210 finished harvesting F51 potatoes, uuh what an ordeal... no more, never again! haha <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So first I purchased those two 300k liter placeables, then I started to haul 140k truck loads to gunther and once that got old I started to dump the potatoes into back end of the field into a huge mountain of potatoes. It is clear to me that the grain (at least potatoes) pile on the ground does not even come close to the actual liter amount as the pile is super small compared to the endless truck loads I dumped there. Oh well its FS17 for you.
</p>

<p>
If I only feed the potatoes to my pigs (which I purchase soon), it will last me for two life times hehe, I highly doubt I'll be planting more potatoes in this savegame, there just is no need after this monster mountain of potatoes.
</p>

<p>
0234 started fertilizing F51<br>
0235 plow fixes for F08 done<br>
0319 finished fertilizing F08, forgot to write start time heh<br>
0322 started plowing F15
</p>

<p>
I was ploughing F15 which was in the corner of wide open landscape without anything on the horizon and I realized how good I felt to break into this north west section of this terrain which has large square fields, I think I'm going to like farming here <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Most likely I try to purchase fields in this area now before expanding elsewhere, this NW is like the mirror image of the NE which has the smallest fields of this terrain and probably the most busy area.
</p>

<p>
I just love so much of the large open areas without objects for your vehicles to collide into or lack of parking space. Now don't get me wrong I don't want an objectless flat terrain, oh no, but like the most horrendous piece of garbage you can find are these claustrophobic BRITISH terrains where I would never ever imagine myself farming.
</p>

<p>
0418 finished plowing F15<br>
0439 plow fixes for F15 done<br>
0443 started plowing F16<br>
0447 started fertilizing F15<br>
0504 finished fertilizing F15<br>
0504 finished fertilizing F51<br>
0519 finished plowing F16<br>
0547 started fertilizing F16<br>
0601 finished fertilizing F16<br>
0624 started fertilizing F33<br>
0718 finished fertilizing F33<br>
0959 finished harvesting F49
</p>

<p>
F49 was accidentally planted with soybeans and wheat, it happened when I started courseplay courses using new seedhawk planter which was used the first time and obviously it defaults to wheat.
</p>

<p>
But this accident brought in some new information, I had two rows side by side soybeans and wheat, the wheat row would yield roughly twice as much grain than soybeans. So even as soybeans is pretty much twice more value on the market wheat still gets you a lot of money because you get so damn much of it (yield).
</p>

<p>
1022 shut down FS17 for today, quite exhausted of playing already, I think it finally starts to wear me out, heh we'll see. More farming tomorrow.
