After a meal and watching some welker farm youtube videos, somehow I felt... not ready to continue with F33, F35 and F50 harvests because I expected to get tired soon, had that semi tired / exhausted feeling. Hmm and only been playing 13hrs straight, thats nothing, I should have at least 3-4hrs more hours left in me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh and also I was hesitant to start harvests as weather indicator shows rain, odd thing is that its the current weather indicator, but I see no rain hmm.
</p>

<p>
0819 yeah didn't feel like continuing with the harvests so shut down FS17 for today (judging by how many hours I've been at it today), won't go to sleep yet but have to stop short today, if someone could call 13hrs straight a "short" heh. Anyways more farming tomorrow.
