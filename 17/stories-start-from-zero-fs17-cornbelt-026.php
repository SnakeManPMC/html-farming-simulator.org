	<h2>2018-10-31 Heavy Duty Seeding</h2>

<p>
1934 back at PMC Gaming, started up FS17, harvest continues.
</p>

<p>
Wheat gives so much yield its crazy, that F47 was rather large and I had two 140k liter trucks and brent avalance 1596 auger wagons running constantly and still the 4 harvesters got completely full quite often heh.
</p>

<p>
2216 started seeding canola on F49<br>
2218 finished harvesting F47<br>
2246 finished seeding F49
</p>

<p>
Decided not to finish baling straw on F48, or any field in fact. I have enought of straw bales already, several 16 bale piles in north side of F49. Those will last me for a long time to be used as animal bedding and cow food.

Been a long day, I should move the four Big Bud's down south to F33 and F35 for some heavy duty seeding, but I'm quite exhausted and don't have "energy" to drive one of them down there (and rest would come after using courseplay).
</p>

<p>
Just finishing fertilizing F11 with the old shop refill system using only two steyr multis heh. Maybe tomorrow market prices are better so I could sell some crops to get money and upgrade those spreaders.
</p>

<p>
Anyways been very nice day today, been playing almost sixteen hours now heh, very nice day indeed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1128hrs dropped to NEGATIVE budget hehe. Its now -$23k, wow how did that happen? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright lets bring the budget now above one million and then keep it there. Seems like my "but this was a good deal to buy these two fields" brought the budget to negative side, ouch. And to remind you, my budget the CASH flow might be on minus but I have millions of liters crops in farm silo so I could get millions in cash by just hauling them for sale, so its not like I'm broke heh.
</p>

<p>
1329 finished fertilizing F11<br>
