	<h2>2018-10-25 Money Train Keeps On Rolling</h2>

<p>
1504 back at PMC Gaming, starting up FS17, lets harvest...<br>
1540 soybeans market price for maplefield mills is increasing but the other sellpoints already stopped, its now on green $4,609 and increasing
</p>

<p>
I'm writing this several days since I drove the "money train" into maplefield mills to wait until the price is right so feels like ages for me. Now I already have <i>two</i> million liter of soybeans in farm silo and the biggest fields are like half way harvested and then I still have F44, F45 and F50 left to harvest heh, I'm scared to think how many liters I end up.
</p>

<p>
What that means is when the price stops increasing and hopefully its above $5k I'm starting to sell doing the market finance game, when the train is empty I race back to farm fill it up and going back to maplefield to sell some more as long as I have grain and the price is high.
</p>

<p>
If I manage to pull this off... like said I'm scared to even think how many millions I end up with heh. Exciting times <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1624 soybeans market prices unfortunately seems to have stalled to $4,672 as it takes extremely long time to increase one dollar
</p>

<p>
I'm little bit worried that the price has again stalled to this same 4.6k level, if so, then I have to sell because it was such a torture to live this one game-day without money.
</p>

<p>
1636 finished harvesting F35<br>
1655 started harvesting F45<br>
1702 well looks like soybean price does increase although extremely slow, it feels like its on the stalled state but it does increase, its now $4,699<br>
1712 finished harvesting F11<br>
1736 soybeans market price in maplefield mills stopped increasing at $4,700 even
</p>

<p>
Damn shame I wished over $5k... damn damn damn <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well also I have 2.9 million liters of soybeans in farm silo and I haven't even started harvesting F50, oh my that is some serious load of crops <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I really really hate to sell my crops with less than $5k but the price has twice now stalled to around $4.7k as its now so after the potatoes madness day+ I really do not wish to sit on my hands waiting for price to be right, I think its time to start selling and getting some PROGRESS on this field purchasing farm business.
</p>

<p>
It is time...
</p>

<p>
1745 started to sell "money train" soybeans contents, sold first car for $672k, damn so low money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>

</p>

<p>
Immediately started train and raced to farm silos to load another 1.647 million liters of soybeans for sale before the market price plummets again
</p>

<p>
On F50 I tried six (6)! combine harvester setup... which went, excuse my language, completely to SHIT. I mean the first harvester sped off without combining and used wrong course lane, then soon after first harvesters collided and soon there after it was one big stinking mess. It was much like watching The Benny Hill Show when these harvesters were goofing around.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I think in order to run such numbers of harvesters you need to have 300+ hectare field to have the benefit and ROOM for them to maneuver, anything less and you should use less harvesters, I mean whats the point of throwing more than 4 harvesters to a 20 hectare field.
</p>

0440 finished plowing F45<br>
0511 took truck load of 140k liters of wheat to stanton sawmill, dumped into the eastern silo with the water tank
</p>

<p>
When you dump water and wheat to this location, you'll get seeds overtime. I don't know how long it takes, but I got my first 2500 liters of seeds in the time I was writing this farming log entry.
</p>

<p>
You have to pickup the seeds by train, you can't access them with truck.
</p>

<p>
0540 took another truck load of soybeans for the other side of stanton sawmill to produce fuel and compost.<br>
0601 took another truck load of wheat for making seeds. at this time I already had 25k liters of seeds done, cool!
</p>

<p>
Seems like the days of purchasing seeds are over as the factory produces so high quantity of seeds. Hopefully the fertilizer side of things works the same.
</p>

<p>
0621 took truck load 140k liter of potatoes to gunther for $99k + $97k, budget now $24.464m<br>
0640 purchased slurry tank placeable for $8.5k, placed it to stanton sawmill for easy access<br>
0645 finished plowing F11<br>
0714 used tanker truck to bring 80k liter of slurry into fertilizer factory, it immediately started to produce fertilizer as I had a bit of compost there already<br>
0814 quite tired but more like exhausted, so shut down FS17 and continue tomorrow.
