	<h2>Introduction to Terrain Editing FS17</h2>

<p>
When I started editing FS17 it was sometime in 2018 but I don't have exact dates as there was no developer diaries written at the time, I had terrain editing experience dating back to year 2000 with <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/f4/" target="_blank">Falcon 4.0 theaters</a> and <a href="https://pmc.editing.wiki" target="_blank">ofp/arma editing</a> since 2001. FS17 was my very first Farming Simulator game I played and soon after started editing it.

<p>
Beginners tutorial how to make a terrain for Farming Simulator 17 (FS17). I wrote this tutorial knowing absolutely <b>nothing</b> about Farming Simulator terrain editing so this should help all the beginners / newbies, just like me. I do not claim this is a good tutorial or a proper way to make FS17 terrain, but it is what I googled and learned.
</p>

<p>
With the game came GAMEDIR/sdk/moddingHandbook/FarmingSimulatorModding_en.pdf manual for basic mod making, it is very good read when getting started.
