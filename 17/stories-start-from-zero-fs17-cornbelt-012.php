1022 soybeans market price started to drop, I frantically started to load train for sale...
</p>

<p>
So yeah market price started to drop just as I was harvesting last row of F34 after which I already intended to go sell soybeans. Now I'm in rush to get train loaded and driven over there before the price drops too much. I'm thinking that because the price is dropping, now I'm not going to be able to play any financial market game so when I get there, I just start to sell, Sell, SELL.
</p>

<p>
1030 train sold $761k + $736k + $712k + $687k + $510k, budget now $4.170m
</p>

<p>
I didn't have time to see how much the price dropped while I drove train there, but quick calculation shows that first car sell was with $5,321 and seeing the last full car being only $4,804 so yeah there was definite market price drop going on. I'm just glad to manage sell as quickly as I could now.
</p>

<p>
Can't wait for the next time price skyrockets on soybeans, then I'll be ready with one million liter train load hehe.
</p>

<p>
1030 finished harvesting F34<br>
1058 started fertilizing F34<br>
1108 took train with 66k liters of soybeans to maplefield mills SE sellpoint for $340k, budget now $4.511m
</p>

<p>
That small tiny 66k liters was just to clear my silo and complete the transactions heh, still the price was over $5k so always worth to sell stuff with that kind of prices.
</p>

<p>
1155 finished plowing F44, yeah forgot to write down starting time. I wonder why do I have a such an hurry that I cant keep proper log? Hmm, good question...<br>
1217 finished fertilizing F34<br>
1225 started fertilizing F44
</p>

<p>
Field 11 is oddly done by the terrain developer as only a small square of otherwise a very large field is registered with the game. The registered square is 48 hectares and I bet the surrounding non-registered area is probably 20 hectares heh. So I'm thinking business wise should I buy more vehicles or this field as it is also fully grown wheat, so I could get the money from that harvest as well. After thinking and marveling the size and location of the field, I decided to buy it.
</p>

<p>
1245 finished fertilizing F44<br>
1246 purchased F11 for $3.959m<br>
1250 started harvesting F11<br>

1440 started seeding soybeans on F34<br>
? finished harvesting F50, forgot to write when started, can't help myself hehe<br>
1616 finished seeding F34
</p>

<p>
When I was harvesting F11 I checked the actual size using courseplay and I bursted out laughing as it was 99.98 hectares, whoah yeah a bit over "20" then hehe. Also getting over 400k liters wheat harvest from this "for free" as well, currently price is $1905 so it will bring down the field price roughly $750k heh nice.
