	<h2>2018-11-01 All Day Every Day</h2>

<p>
2353 back at PMC Gaming, FS17 already running, lets continue farming...
</p>

<p>
<b>2018-11-02T0007</b> wasn't feeling the desire to farming, but gotta do it man. I drove first Big Bud from F16 to F33
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that at least for today I'm going to try to split up my four Big Bud's into two teams, north and south. I do have to take good care not to have them collide each other on seeding or fieldwork mode so maybe this split up makes them easier to manage. Also the traveling between north and south is just pain with these slow 32km/h monsters like I just did right now. We'll see how it feels to work with only two of them, maybe the seeding/ploughing times increase to several hours again who knows.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday while seeding I learned a lesson that never ever start seeding or fertilizing until you have refilled the vehicle seed/fertilizer tanks and seed/fertilizer tender auger wagon standing by. Otherwise you most likely will run out of products and then your vehicles are standing idle on the field while you hurry up to get auger wagon from where ever it might be. This is especially bad on seeding because long seeding times might cause first growth stage to switch on the headlands while you are still seeding.
</p>

<p>
0125 started seeding canola on F33<br>
0151 started seeding canola on F48<br>
0159 started fertilizing F08<br>
0207 started fertilizing F51<br>
0225 started fertilizing F15
</p>

<p>
I set the two steyr multi 4115 with KUHN EMC spreaders to empty their fertilizer tanks in F15 and then I'm going to drive them back to shop and sell them. Just wanted to drive them dry so no fertilizer is lost when selling.
</p>

<p>
0231 finished seeding F33<br>
0236 finished fertilizing F08<br>
0243 finished seeding F48<br>
0246 sold steyr multi 4115 tractor, KUHN EMC sprayer and some tractor weight<br>
0252 started seeding canola on F35<br>
0257 sold steyr multi 4115 tractor, KUHN EMC sprayer and some tractor weight<br>
0303 john deere 7030 with bredal 20k liter spreader tanks continued what the sold steyr multis started on F15<br>
0318 finished fertilizing F15<br>
0321 started fertilizing F16<br>
0338 finished fertilizing F16
</p>

<p>
Decided to take my 250k liters of barley for sale, it had the best price of non soybeans crops now. This was just to clear myself out of the negative budget and perhaps if it gives me enough money then buy those bredal spreaders (probably not).
</p>

<p>
0405 took train load of 250k of barley to sell in maplefield mills, market price was $2,160, sold for $309k + $233k, budget now $496k<br>
0406 finished fertilizing F51<br>
0415 started fertilizing F46<br>
0426 finished seeding F35<br>
0457 finished fertilizing F46<br>
0531 started fertilizing F34<br>
0646 finished fertilizing F34<br>
0747 installed commodity prices mod so I can monitor soybean market price without going back and forth with the sluggish ESC map and price page
</p>

<p>
Now I'm kind of just waiting for market price to go up so I can sell and get some progress to this savegame.
</p>

<p>
It was 2018-10-28 in real life days when I purchased the last fields, the goal of this savegame is to purchase all the fields. So I have spent all these days, oh my had to actually double check but its been 3-4 days depending how you count them since that purchase... no new fields in four real life days of playing?
</p>

<p>
Umm what am I doing here, how does this drag for this long. I mean you have to understand that I'm playing all day every day, check the times in this "log" and you'll see... all that playing results to what? Sure I have large amount of soybeans in my farm silos but as the price kind of sucks... I'm just spinning my wheels here.
</p>

<p>
Well okay not spinning wheels as I'm working on the fields constantly, I don't just sit by idle while time goes by, I guess eventually as the soybeans market price goes up I have mega amounts of it to sell. But yeah getting a 20+ million payday after every so many days... uh man this is taking way too long.
</p>

<p>
I'm not smart enough to calculate or imagine what would the <i>long term game-play</i> difference be if I just sold ANYTIME the market price settles to a decent amount, like lets say over $4000, I mean if you sell 1.647 million liters of soybeans for $4k and then $5k its $6.588m vs $8.235m so damn $1.647m difference. One and a half million dollars go up in the smoke, poof. That is not good, why on earth would you sell your crops with such a lower price. Imagine how many vehicles could you buy with that difference, that lost money?
</p>

<p>
Currently I have 3.290 million liters of soybeans and 1.255 million liters of wheat in farm silo (plus most fields planted with canola heh), if I would sell all the soybeans as current market price is stable at $4273 it would get me mere 14,058,170 million.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in this savegame I saw the $5300 market price just ONCE and would have to scan the log up to see if I ever sold above 5k since, so who knows how many in-game days when market prices change I would have to wait for optimum prices.
</p>

<p>
Hmm dunno, just dunno man...
</p>

<p>
0827 started plowing F60<br>
0828 started plowing F61<br>
0941 finished plowing F60<br>
0946 finished plowing F61<br>
1022 purchased grimme sl 80-22 quantum conveyor belt for $12k
</p>

<p>
Used tractor to pull the grimme conveyor belt to stanton sawmill, there I purchased manure shop where this "filltrigger" conveyor belt works to buy manure. Yes slurry and manure placeables are borderline cheating, but it is impossible to get that many animals that they would produce enough of shit to last for a large farm.
</p>

<p>
Now I get to supply my fertilizer factory with slurry and manure so I have good supply for resources as the compost from crude oil and grain just ain't enough.
</p>

<p>
Also this manure shop will supply manure spreader implement for south west region once I buy Big Bud 450 and that bouchard 70k liter manure spreader.
</p>

<p>
