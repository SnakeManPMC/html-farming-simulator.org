<p>
PMC Farm Lab is a tiny terrain kilometer and file size wise to quickly test newly downloaded mods, vehicles, implements, placeables, etc. For example simple thing as having vehicle shop real close to fields where to test your implements etc. Also this is excellent test terrain for Precision Farming.
</p>

<p>
<b>This terrain is not meant for regular farming game-play.</b>
</p>

<p>
When you download new mods you should never add them without testing to your precious old savegames because bad mods riddled with errors can easily break your save, yes you should backup your savegames but still its a nuisance to restore those. This is where PMC Farm Lab helps.
</p>

<p>
Very small terrain and mod file size allows you to quickly load it up. Once you are in-game vehicle shop, buy station for fertilizer, lime and seeds are right next to a row of small fields to test your vehicles and implements on. Even though this is small terrain there is plenty of empty flat space to place new placeables.
</p>

<p>
White shape in PDA image is the vehicle shop building. Shorter row of fields are the 1-8 numbered AI field definition fields, longer row of fields are non AI fields with pre planted crops. Buy station and farm bin silo are located right side of vehicle shop.

<p>
Unfortunately there are no built-in money cheat yet so you could buy all the new mod vehicles etc you desire. Farm manager game-mode gives you 1.250 million and you can of course use <a href="settings.php">developer console</a> gsCheatMoney to add money. If you lease vehicles/implements then 1.250 million should last quite a while. If you know how to "initialize map" with extra money, please let me know and it will be added to this terrain.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Precision Farming mod then those 14 non AI fields in the upper row will not get soil sampled using paUncoverAll developer console command. This is because paUncoverAll uses field definitions which these pre planted harvest ready fields do not have.
</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
2019-03-13 was when this terrain was created (or my last note of that time), simply from a need of fast loading small terrain where easily test new mods. First iteration was 2 kilometers x 2 kilometers in size. In 2020 terrain was re-created from scratch using smaller 1.2 kilometers size just to show people <a href="terrain-use-actual-size.php">howto use actual terrain size</a> heh.
</p>

<p>
Asked around ideas from players in discord, got some nice ideas what to include, some of them are already in others you can check from changelog page. If you have further ideas how to make such mod testing terrain more useful please let me know.
</p>
