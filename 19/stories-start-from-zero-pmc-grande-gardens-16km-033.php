	<h2>2019-11-14 Soybeans Harvest With 8 Combines</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-11-14T0139</b> New farming day has begun, PMC Gaming up, FS19 up, lets get to it.
</p>

<p>
04/early-autumn in-game 2000hrs, night is falling so we need to time accelerate until the morning light. Then we get to commence harvesting F02 soybeans.
</p>

<p>
0150 Started harvesting soybeans F02, courseplay ETA 1h 26min, 4x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
Again it felt great to be back farming as it feels on most mornings heh. Another great farming day has started, cant wait to see what we can accomplish today.
</p>

<p>
0411 Finished harvesting soybeans F02
</p>

<p>
Alright another soybean field done. Soybean farm bin silos are now 6.306m liters and railroad silo 4 2.672m liters. I cant tell how much is on the farm 1 bin and in farm 2 bin.
</p>

<p>
Next field to go is F51 harvest ready soybeans. Nice 360ha size field heh, it will take a few hours to harvest. Need to dump grain into railroad silo 6 which is right next to the field, will be quick single truck operation.
</p>

<pre>
- harvester claas lexion 8900 18k liter with guidance steering 504.5k
- header 18m midwest durus with colors 169.4k

</p>

</pre>

<p>
051 Purchased the above list, budget now 325.8kk<br>
</p>

<p>
Then had to transfer all my vehicles into F51 which was quite the ordeal, slow combines 42kph driving even through stupid sugar beet fields were just taking so long time to get there.
</p>

<p>
Idea was to try eight (8) combines in one field, I don't think it will be practical or even work maybe the crap FS19 engine loses all FPS performance to the courseplay hired workers we'll see. But at least I want to try it out so I can be able to say I did it.
</p>

<p>
0607 Started harvesting soybeans F51, courseplay ETA 2h 47min, <b>8x tools</b><br>
0810 Lunch break...<br>
0833 Feeding done, harvest continues<br>
1223 Finished harvesting soybeans F51

<p>

</p>

<p>
Total soybeans in the railroad silos 4 and now 6 is 5.372m heh and the same as before for farm bin silo 6.306m which is total of 11.678 damn million liters! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
How about if we don't calculate how much money that will makes us heh, have to keep it as surprise, but yeah it will be <i>decent</i> amount <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
