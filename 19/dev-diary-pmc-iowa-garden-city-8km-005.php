	<h2>2021-04-27 Windows 8.1 And Tree Object Placement Continues</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-04-27T15:16:00Z</b> Started to watch PMC Iowa Garden City 8km developer diary VIDEOS that I recorded in 2020, to get some reference point where I left off in october, that is the last time I added trees to this terrain.
</p>

<p>
I'm quite bummed out that its been this long with just slacking, not doing any editing for this terrain. I've been so burnt out lately for all computer work its very hard to start/continue editing. Luckily I seem to start to get that editing fire back <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-04-27T17:43:00Z Finished watching those previously recorded videos and was really surprised that on october 2020 I did not record anything or write these dev diary entries even though I placed a lot of trees. Hmm that is weird, I thought recording and writing was being done all the time, hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-27T23:02:00Z Took backups of PMC Iowa Garden City 8km and then fired up GE, lets see if we could place some trees again.
</p>

<p>
2021-04-27T23:19:00Z Alright first farm yard trees done for 2021 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Note: here I have installed Windows 8.1 64bit using extra large 200% user interface scaling. This is clearly seen with larger text font and UI in general, also hard disk partition changed with operating system re-install.
</p>

<p>
Second farm yard, this one had really bad building model type selections as there clearly was some pig sheds but I don't have any FS19 data/ pig sheds to use and haven't found any white iowa looking ones from the community mods.

Farm yard with few bin silos.

<p>
One lone bin silo in this farm yard.

<p>
Another farm yard trees placed.

<p>
Actually I am not going to screenshot every yard, it would bloat this web page size quite a bit because there are I think 50+ farm yards heh. I'll try to screenshot most complex or interesting looking tree placements now.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-28T01:30:00Z</b> Was watching twitch live stream when penalty_box_gaming was playing <a href="pmc-grande-gardens-16km.php">PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a> v1.1.10, had all editing tools open in the background but burnt out me just spent time watching the stream. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
By the time his stream ended, I was already yawning tired and had no interest of concentrating on editing. This is what happens when you are burnt out for editing / computer work. It really sucks.
