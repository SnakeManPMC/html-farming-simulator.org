<p>
Mods Trailer Autoloading for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Autoloading trailers automatically pickup nearby objects, being bales, pallets, liquid tanks etc. It is very handy tool to use around the farm yard. If you want to load every trailer manually using various skids steers, telehandlers, wheel loaders or tractor attached front loaders, then you don't need autoloading trailer, but its a lot of work to properly load a big trailer manually.

v1.0 by GIANTS Software. From modDesc: Fliegl DPW 180 Squarebale Autoload. Includes: Fliegl DPW 180 for roundbales (Shop: baling). Fliegl DPW 180 for squarebales (Shop: baling).

<p>
Notes: As the name says its for SQUARE bales, round bales not supported, nor any other items like pallets of seed/fertilizer etc. Loads 24 square bales, tension straps do not seem to work but they are just eyecandy anyways. Unloading is very easy as you can use LMB mouse move to move the load of bales into either side easily, it will cover a nice distance to the side as well for good unloading location. While its doing great job loading square bales, it would have been great to have universal loading of any type of object (round bales and pallets), for this reason I'll pass on this one and wait for universal auto loader trailer.

</p>

<p>
Notes: Unfortunately the shop purchase icons are in german, it just says "autoload" and in the actual description "Mit Aufbau" and another is "Standart", sigh, never release a mod in any other language than english. The mit afbauUGAHUGAH works fine, didnt test the stan-dart.

<p>
A lot of options for unloading to place that marker... which unfortunately is steel grid and on top of asphalt/concrete it is really difficult to see, you basically have to move it around to spot that ah there it is. Auto loading and unloading works fine, huge selection of different loadable objects from square/round bales to pallets to eggboxes etc. Unfortunately at first try the usage of this was very cumbersome with the unloading many different keys and hard to spot marker. But this is what we got now as universal auto loader so better get used to it until something better comes along.
