<p>
1850 Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 started up, harvest continues. Should take no time to finish F05 NE now. This savegame as 715 hours in it now.<br>
2019 Finished harvesting soybeans F05 NE.<br>
2036 Started harvesting soybeans F05 NW, courseplay 4 tools ETA 4h ?min.
</p>

<p>
Again forgot to write the precise courseplay duration time down, it was 4hrs 4min when I checked at mid point of the first edge, so perhaps 10 maybe 15min dunno.
</p>

<p>
2148 Hmm I think something happened to my warrior++ semi-truck which was hauling grain... it... it, disappeared <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to take a lunch break and figure this thing out after a meal.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-09-15T0046</b> Was getting bored so before burning myself out for today I decided to call it an early night.
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: 2024-01-28T20:24:00Z, merged too short page again.</i>
</p>

<p>
1617 Today I reverted back to single player savegame as I could not get any multiplayer going on. Its just not happening so why bother suffering from the limitations of MP mode.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 720 hours in it.
</p>

<p>
Felt good to be back in SP using vehicleExplorer mod, it was such an horrific limitation not be able to jump into any vehicle directly, so glad to have vehicleExplorer back.
</p>

<p>
1952 Finished harvesting soybeans F05 NW.
</p>

<p>
History was made today, F05 is the largest field I have ever harvested in farming simulator games, it is massive 1205ha in size. Next closest prior to this was some 600ha field I believe F22 is something of that size, now were talking twice the size. Just awesome! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After finishing the field, emptying combines and grain carts to trucks I saved game and exited for little break, probably going to figure out if I want to continue harvesting either small F17 or that massive F30.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-09-16T0022</b> Started FS19 up again, lets see if I can start to harvest the next field, not really feeling enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
0059 Started harvesting F30 NE, courseplay ETA 1h 35min.<br>
? Finished harvesting F30 NE
</p>

<p>
0410 Time to call it a night.
