	<h2>2021-02-22 Utility Poles With Wires</h2>

<p>
<b>After a long break from editing this terrain...</b> last time I edited was on september last year, now february 2021 editing continues.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-02-22T02:10:00Z</b> Decided to hastily re-create few lines of utility poles with wires, just for todays <a href="stories-from-zero-iowa-garden-city-unofficial.php">Unofficial Start From Zero</a> game-play <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Found one utility pole line which was created but never placed into the "public" Utility_poles transformgroup and was left into PMC_Helpers, that was odd. Well I re-created that right away with wires and placed into public.
</p>

<p>
Then I re-created the line going west from garden city town... and then few other locations as well.
</p>

<p>
There are so many utility pole lines it feels like they are everywhere, just re-created these few so I can have some wires to look at in-game today <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
