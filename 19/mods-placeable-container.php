	<h2>HoT Fillables</h2>

<p>
v1.2.0.19 by SanAndreas. From modDesc: HoT Fillables
</p>

<p>
HoT_Fillables.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: includes big liquid manure (slurry?) storage, little liquid manure (slurry?) storage, big digestate storage, little digestate storage, milk house and water tank. I assume these are as name says fillable, so you can put these fill types into them, then later take it out. Looks like german language text on some placeables. No idea where I got them, searching today I only find some global company versions which these do not appear to be (at least cant find any "GC" scripts). Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.

</p>

<p>
Notes: Quote: <i>Hereâ€™s the next gift for you guys. The first is my fuel tank from Lincoln Creek made to be placeable. The second is a set of commodity bulk tanks. They are placeable and fill seed, solid fertilizer and lime. There were some previously released that were poorly done and I decided fs19mods.com to fix them up by scaling them down to proper size, retexturing with UDIM and adjusting the scripting as well as some model fixes and reducing file sizes.</i>

Notes: In the mod selection screen nice typo in the name for all places "Meridan" heh. However if you forget that typo, the model itself looks nice and works as expected, you can refuel from it.
