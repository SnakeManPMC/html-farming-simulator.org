	<h2>HoT Fillables</h2>

<p>
v1.2.0.19 by SanAndreas. From modDesc: HoT Fillables
</p>

<p>
HoT_Fillables.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: includes big liquid manure (slurry?) storage, little liquid manure (slurry?) storage, big digestate storage, little digestate storage, milk house and water tank. I assume these are as name says fillable, so you can put these fill types into them, then later take it out. Looks like german language text on some placeables. No idea where I got them, searching today I only find some global company versions which these do not appear to be (at least cant find any "GC" scripts). Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.

<p>
Notes: Quote: <i>Here’s the next gift for you guys. The first is my fuel tank from Lincoln Creek made to be placeable. The second is a set of commodity bulk tanks. They are placeable and fill seed, solid fertilizer and lime. There were some previously released that were poorly done and I decided fs19mods.com to fix them up by scaling them down to proper size, retexturing with UDIM and adjusting the scripting as well as some model fixes and reducing file sizes.</i>

Notes: In the mod selection screen nice typo in the name for all places "Meridan" heh. However if you forget that typo, the model itself looks nice and works as expected, you can refuel from it.

<h2>Fueltank 5000l</h2>

</p>

<p>
2019-02-21 tested and works OK. Solid little placeable fuel tank where you can refuel your vehicles. Yes this placeable doesnt need fuel carried over to it, this basically creates fuel out of thin air. Just wanted to be clear about the function of this placeable, I thought first this just <i>stores</i> the fuel.

<h2>Placeable Refill Tanks</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by GIANTS Software. From modDesc: Seed, solid fertilizer, liquid fertilizer and herbicide tanks which are placeable on the map.
</p>

<p>
Note: Refilling will cost you a higher price for seed/fertilizer/herbicide than buying it in BigBags/pallets/etc at the Shop. For some odd reason these refill tanks do NOT include lime, which unfortunately means you should probably just get some community made refill station pack instead.
