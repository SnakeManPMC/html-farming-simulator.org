<p>
There had been no viewers other than 1-2 and besides friend of mine nobody in the chat, neither twitch or youtube. I therefore decided after some consideration over several weeks (recent times, streams) that I will not live stream anymore. Why stream when there is nobody watching, its a waste of time. I'll focus now on farming-simulator.org website and 4k high bitrate videos for youtube.
</p>

<p>
In a bizarre way I was hoping there is no viewers and nobody chatting so I can without hesitation call it quits for live streaming. If by a miracle there was 10+ viewers on both twitch and youtube then of course I would continue streaming. But the first 2h 45min was completely dead, nobody watching nobody chatting.
</p>

<p>
Around 3h 53min mark of live stream still nobody chatting or even watching, so I thought that fuck it and started to watch someone elses stream muted while still playing and streaming FS19. I'll let this stream go now as long as it goes, like last chance of anyone watching, but I'm not going to waste my time monitoring chat.

<b>2021-05-02T0055</b> Finished harvesting soybeans F82 NE

<p>
After finishing F82 NE section it was perfect time to end live streaming as I was starving. Live stream duration was 4hrs 33min and as said zero activity.
</p>

<p>
Was going to take a lunch break here but also thinking... unless I get sudden burst of motivation this will be it for todays farming.
</p>

<p>
Cleaned OBS so wanted to right away test that 4k 60fps video capturing works flawlessly, so going to start harvesting F82 SE section.
</p>

<p>
0240 Started harvesting soybeans F82 SE, courseplay ETA 2h 42min, 4x tools.
