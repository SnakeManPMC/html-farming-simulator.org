	<h2>PMC Grande Gardens 16km, Start From Zero</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-07-15T1910</b> Started <a href="pmc-grande-gardens-16km.php">PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a> new farmer mode in single player and saved career. Then edited savegame for PMC start from zero mode :)
</p>

<p>
The goal of this start from zero was to test how this terrain works in such career mode, well it was immediately clear that there is no good starter contract because either they are way too large or too small. The quickest / smallest harvest contract was for 4 hectare field which paid 7.6k and took away 0.8k for leased vehicles. The next larger was huge 302 hectare field which paid whopping 545k, but that is such an insane workload for starter harvest that it would take me with one leased combine for days to make, no joke.
</p>

<p>
All other contracts were even larger, like one 1 million harvest or suitable sizes but they didn't offer borrowed / leased vehicles. There simple was no contract I could take and spend few hours (or hopefully less) to do and get enough cash to be ready to lease my own rubicon, buy fertilize pallets and start to do fertilizing contracts which are the big money.
</p>

<p>
So right off the bat I decided to time accelerate some and wait for better contracts as that 7k just aint enough to get started.
</p>

<p>
1949 Got harvest for potatoes on F89 for 23.9k which was nice for the money but still not sure how terrible is 4ha potatoes hmm.<br>
1954 Accepted contract for harvesting potatoes F89, for 23.9k reward.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yep after quick consideration decided to take this contract as there was so many lucrative fertilizing contracts available, that if I miss this opportunity I might have to sit in time acceleration for days until the next batch of fert contracts appear. Lets hope this was not a big mistake to do potato harvest :)
</p>

<p>
2006 Started harvesting potatoes F89<br>
</p>

<p>
And I was right on my initial thought that do not take potato or sugar beet/cane contracts as those are pure horror to harvest hehe. Even though 4ha is a tiny tiny field, it is still quite large for this type of harvest. But hey, it was the only small/quick harvest as I definitely would not have taken the crazy 300ha wheat harvest.
</p>

<p>
2026 First trailer load of potatoes is full, time to start driving to selling point 7 and back, oh my...<br>
2310 Still going and was quite frustrated how tedious and slow this potato contract actually was.
</p>

<p>
I should have just aborted the contract when realizing how stupid it was, but I'm a stubborn guy that if I decided to do something I'll do it. But let this mistake be the last time I'll do one of these root crops as I KNOW they suck. That 724 vario tractor was also extremely frustrating as the TAW 30 trailer weighed so much that it pulled the tractor from left to right constatly, you could not drive straight on a road, it was constant left/right steering back and forth.
</p>

<p>
Sure this is the point of start from zero to suffer in the beginning, that the nice large equipment and your own large fields feel so much better then when you get the big money, but man... this is terrible, hehe. Hopefully these various start from zero stories also teach me how to avoid these time wasting pitfalls in the future.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-16T0001</b> Checking out contracts I saw there was now oat harvest of 46ha field, yes that is quite big field for such contract and then you have to drive the grain to the selling point too, but a bit more, literally few hours in-game time waiting I could have gotten better, more interesting harvest contract heh.
</p>

<p>
It probably took more time to drive this 53kph tractor to selling point 7 several times than the actual potato harvest itself. I never timed how many minutes it is one way but felt like 10-15mins heh.
</p>

<p>
While this potato harvest was terrible, it gave me so valuable information about terrain design, that if you have only massive or tiny fields... you get equally priced contracts and that the selling point location plays important part too. I'm going to edit this terrain so that there are more small to medium sized fields for these start from zero careers. I'm personally obviously doing it just this once, but if any other player out there wishes to do it when this terrain is released, now they have much better field setup.
</p>

<p>
Doing this potato harvest was even more worse because the tractor kept steering left/right and I wasnt using courseplay in the tradition of start from zero career early beginnings.
</p>

<p>
0033 Finished harvesting potatoes F89, contract. This happened while I was dumping the potatoes to selling point 7, got 5.2k to my own pocket too. I decided to suffer some more driving boredom and go harvest the little thats left on the field and come one more time to selling point 7 to sell them, I bet it gets me another fertilizer pallet from the vehicle shop.<br>
0050 Finished the actual harvest of the field, now we just haul the last load of 11.7k liters of potatoes to selling point 7.<br>
0105 Collected F89 potato contract reward 23.1k. Budget now 37.2k :)
</p>

<p>
Now I had enough money to lease rubicon 9000 sprayer and few thousands left over to buy fertilizer, but the problem is that I still missed the fertilizing contract window as there are only two of them left now, both are massive 560ha field contracts for million each, I don't have enough money to buy that much fertilizer to get the job done, ouch :(
</p>

<p>
So I decided to time accelerate again and wait for smaller fertilizing contract to which I have enough money for to buy the actual fertilizer product. This was one of those painful waiting periods, when you got the harvest season going on it will take a lot of time accelerating to get into next batch of fertilizing contracts again. Its much better let the contracts flow naturally without time skipping, they come when they come, if you sit and wait it really tests your patience heh.
</p>

<p>
Did I mention the 120 time acceleration wait for contracts is <i>boring</i>?
</p>

<p>
0337 Still time accelerating and hammering map view and contracts pages, no fertilizing contracts or anykind which would be doable. Now also weather forecast shows rain coming, well I'm not harvesting so I don't care but its the first rain of this career. In-game time 0540hrs it started to rain.
</p>

<p>
Continued to time accelerate and doing other stuff on the background while waiting, endlessly.. then got so tired that went to sleep, didn't even remember to write down what time that was.
</p>

<p>
1335 Back at PMC Gaming and starting FS19 up, lets continue Start From Zero!<br>
1350 Time accelerating and now fields started to be harvested, a lot of cultivating contracts appeared, few seeding ones as well. Fertilizing contracts cant be far away now. But yeah this waiting is killing me, it feels like I've been sitting in time acceleration in-game time for DAYS.<br>
1428 FINALLY one spraying (herbicide) contract appeared and by miracle it was s small 20.9ha 33.5k reward one. This is something I can do easily.<br>
1430 Accepted contract for fertilizing F64, with borrowed rubicon 9000.<br>
1443 Started fertilizing F64, contract.<br>
1457 Finished fertilizing F64, contract, did not collect the reward yet.
</p>

<p>
My first herbicide contract was done with no GPS or courseplay, like it should be :) I then drove the rubicon 9000 back to the shop and unloaded the remaining 4 or so thousand liters of herbicide to pallets so I can use it later.
</p>

<p>
1507 Collected contract reward 23.9k and therefore returned the borrowed sprayer. Budget now 59.4k<br>
</p>

<p>
I was looking at the many cultivating contracts which would easily pass the time waiting for fertilizing contracts, but I want to keep the tradition of no courseplay use before I have my own vehicles. Yes I know this is silly "rules for no reason" stuff, but if you don't have any rules why not just money cheat and win the game instantly? Right heh. Anyways once I start to use courseplay then such cultivating contracts would be nice fillers as the only effect they have on your game-play is that you cant or at least shouldnt time accelerate when youre doing those (there must be some timeout when the contract expires, even if youre doing it).
</p>

<p>
1550 At in-game time 1146hrs, no idea how many days this is now, it started to rain. Weather overall has been very nice overcast which looks interesting instead of the empty sunny sky. Still no fertilizing contracts, I'm still waiting with time acceleration...<br>
1620 First fertilizing contract appeared, whohoo! :)<br>
1621 Accepted contract for fertilizing F68<br>
1622 Leased rubicon 9000 with guidance steering for 25.7k
</p>

<p>
Felt really good to get first fertilizing contract after all this stupid waiting in time acceleration. When I was waiting it was 120 time and usually ALT-TABbing to do some other stuff, like can you believe it I was reading the <a href="stories-from-zero-garden-city-iowa.php">Iowa Garden City Start From Zero</a> story (yesterday I read the FS17 Cornbelt one) hehe.
</p>

<p>
This first fertilizing contract is for 56.4ha field which gives 111.4k reward, pretty nice starter contract. Hopefully there will be plenty of more when I finish this one. This 56ha is no big deal for rubicon, it will be done quick. I'm planning on using guidance steering here even though this is not my first owned vehicle yet, its just too cumbersome to steer manually, I do not use courseplay until I own my own vehicles.
</p>

<p>
1634 Started fertilizing F68, contract.<br>
1704 Finished fertilizing F68, contract, collected contract reward 111.4k. Budget now 129.2k<br>
</p>

<p>
No fertilizing or spraying contracts, I got leased vehicle, hmm wonder if I start to lose too much money with the hourly lease if I time accelerate when waiting for the contracts to appear. I bet if I return this sprayer there will be more contracts like minute later heh. I drove rubicon to the shop, refilled that one half pallet and then decided to time accelerate some more, the other fertilizing contracts cant be that much far out now...
</p>

<p>
1729 At in-game time 0145hrs it stopped raining.<br>
1756 At in-game time 0000hrs daily vehicle maintenance costs were like 5k or so, this is the leasing stuff. Not too bad actually, well relatively speaking (obviously if you only time accelerate through the whole day for 5k then that sucks). Oh weather forecast is for rain, again, wow.<br>
1800 At in-game time around before 0400hrs it started to rain.<br>
1807 Finally next contract appeared which I'm interested at.<br>
1809 Accepted contract for spraying F62<br>
1818 Started spraying F62, contract.<br>
1831 Finished spraying F62, contract, collected contract reward 33.5k. Budget now 142.1k<br>
</p>

<p>
I drove rubicon 9000 back to the vehicle shop and while doing that was thinking that okay lets lease truck and low boy because this driving around is just huge waste of time, it takes a really long time to drive half across the terrain in this 16km beast :)
</p>

<p>
1913 At in-game time around before 1655hrs stopped raining.<br>
1917 At in-game time 0000hrs 15.6k of vehicle leasing costs, so yeah thats quite a lot for one day especially thinking that I got 33.5k reward from the last contract, measily 15k for the whole day then. Yesterdays profit was 17.9k hmm I'm going to return this leased rubicon before midnight tonight so I don't have to pay another lease cost with the daily payment thing. Unless of course those fertilizing contracts appear.
</p>

<p>
I'm really finding it weird how the fertilizing contracts appear, unless I'm mistaken on previous iowa garden city I received new fertilizing missions every game day, now I blast through days with time acceleration like there is no tomorrow (no pun intended). Hmm wonder if its the crop growth control mod that causes some havoc on the crop stages that they take crazy long to switch or something.
</p>

<p>
This is a huge 16km x 16km terrain so I bet all these long crop growth stage etc switching issues are because of the insane terrain size (insane for FS19 crap engine).
</p>

<p>
1937 Started to see seeding contracts appear, so fertilizing contracts are still far away, returned rubicon 9000 as I'm not going to pay more lease while waiting.<br>
1947 At in-game time 0000hrs no costs were deducted, good.<br>
1952 Decided to remove crop growth control mod, I had no evidence of it causing any issues but I just felt uneasy with it as also it doesn't actually do anything for me now with the default settings unless I'm mistaken. So its just my piece of mind that field stages work as base game sets them (and 16km monster terrain).<br>
2001 At in-game time about 1400hrs it started to rain, oh didn't even notice the weather forecast unless I got lost ALT-TABbing too long heh. It definitely does rain a lot around here.<br>
2009 At in-game time before 0500hrs stopped raining, but weather forecast shows more rain coming (now its sunny skies), regular monsoon season hah.<br>
2012 Switched plant growth to fast, maybe that helps to speed up the harvests and gets me some fertilizing contracts quicker.<br>
2015 At in-game time before 1500hrs it started raining, again.
</p>

<p>
Still no fertilizing contracts, its almost like the game can smell a contract horny farmer hehe. I am pretty sure on the garden city story there was more than enough fertilizing contracts, now it seems like actual real life hours pass by with me sitting here in x120 time acceleration fiddling my thumbs. I am getting really frustrated, almost feel like stop playing right about now.
</p>

<p>
I'm getting paranoid, already start to think that even the x120 time acceleration is too fast to screw up the crop growth stage switching same as x300 or higher does.
</p>

<p>
2025 Shut down FS19 as I was getting physically tired and so frustrated about the current state of game-play, I want to PLAY, not time accelerate. I'll take a nap or something, more farming later.<br>
2331 Back at PMC Gaming, lets continue farming. I had plans to take a nap but instead I watched a movie and after that felt great, wanted to get back to farming and here we are, lets continue time accelerating waiting for those rare fertilizing contracts hehe.<br>
2336 At in-game time 1235hrs stopped raining.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-17T0001</b> Finally fertilizing contract appeared! Yeah!<br>
0002 Accepted contract for fertilizing F12<br>
0003 Leased rubicon 9000 with guidance steering, purchased few more fertilizer pallets, loaded the baby up and off I go.<br>
0010 Started fertilizing F12, contract.<br>
0036 Finished fertilizing F12, contract, collected contract reward 101.1k. Budget now 202.9k.<br>
</p>

<p>
And then again no more fertilizing contracts. The lease price for the vehicle is pretty steep if you do like one contract per lease, but lets hope this time I get bunch of these contracts, but if nothing shows up before in-game midnight (its now 1140hrs) I will return this vehicle because it hasnt been very promising so far...
</p>

<p>
0043 Forecast had rain AGAIN.<br>
0046 Time accelerated almost until in-game midnight and no contracts, so I returned rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
That contract did not take long to complete, it was fairly easy task, but with the lease price I only profited 65.8k from it. The charges were already deducted I did not get any fees at midnight, odd, I though there was hourly usage thing, at least there is daily but guess I already paid it at the time of leasing.
</p>

<p>
0050 At in-game 0030hrs it started to rain. How many rain is this already, feels like it rains every other day hehe.<br>
0054 Time accelerated to in-game morning and still no fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
I'm starting to get more and more frustrated with the lack of fertilizing contracts. There was them back when I had no money for fertilizer product, great ones like two one million contracts which I'd kill for right about now, but yeah... how many frigging in-game days do I have to fast forward to get some, hrr...
</p>

<p>
Can you believe a thought actually crossed my mind that maybe I should give up on this career savegame and it is just impossible to get this stuff started like this. Obviously the hard life of farmer is the great thing in zero starts, that once you get onto your feet then it feels SO MUCH better when you know you've earned all the lands and big buds and cool toys. But I don't know man, this is pretty ridiculous of how many in-game days have I time accelerated, even real life hours played I have spend <i>several hours</i> just doing that, no joke.
</p>

<p>
0115 At in-game time 2330hrs stopped raining.<br>
</p>

<p>
Decided that I'm waiting until in-game morning and if there are no fertilizing contracts by then (oh wow, ultimatum) I'm going to start a career without mods in ravenport to check how often fertilizing contracts appear there. I am still not sure if my own understanding of their frequency is incomplete, I just feel like there should be more as I have thoroughly explained above.
</p>

<p>
0120 In-game morning arrived and guess what, no fertilizing contracts. Saved and exited, I need to test contracts on giants terrain to get a solid reference point.<br>
? didn't write down what time I started back up and just hit x120 time acceleration and started to watch youtube farming videos, I'm so sick and tired of waiting.<br>
0223 Just after writing the above got fertilizing contract for one of the 4ha fields so it was useless and spraying contract for 81.9k reward, however its not worth to lease sprayer because I would only get about fifty grand out of that. Oh and it was raining again heh.<br>
0233 Rain had stopped, still no contracts, blah...<br>
0303 I give up...
</p>

<p>
Still no darn fertilizing contracts, this is insane. Why the hell am I playing a game of time accelerating so that I can play a game? I have played two days now and so far done like what, four contracts? Come on man, are you crazy or what. Enough is enough, I'm done with this shit.
</p>

<p>
There must be something bugging in PMC Grande Gardens 16km terrain as there are no contracts when you x120 time accelerate. I'm giving it a one last chance by not time accelerating anymore, I'm just taking few contracts I can do with courseplay and relax by generally ALT-TABbing doing something else. If in few hours of real life time there is no changes on the contracts list... then its clear that something is bugging with this terrain (or rather giants engine on 16km terrains).
</p>

<p>
0308 Accepted contract for cultivating F57. In-game time is now 0655hrs.<br>
0316 Started cultivating F57<br>
0547 At in-game time 0933hrs still no change in contracts list.<br>
0605 Shut the game down, been up more than 16hrs its time to call it a night... but honestly, dunno what I'm going to do tomorrow with this contract issue...
</p>

<p>
1401 Back at PMC Gaming, against my better judgement I'm giving this career/terrain one more try today. If I don't get any fertilizing contracts to get that old iowa garden city type of fertilizing action going on... then I have to call it quits, probably take a full bank loan and start to grow my farm like that. Dunno what I would do, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.<br>
1406 Back in the cultivating contract, courseplay started and tractor running, duration 40min.<br>
</p>

<p>
1410 Accepted contract for cultivating F31<br>
1413 Started cultivating F31, contract.<br>
1420 Accepted contract for cultivating F28<br>
1436 Started cultivating F28, contract.
</p>

<p>
Three vehicles were cultivating under courseplay (which uses hired workers) and got 30 FPS performance, it wasnt too bad still felt smooth enough but yeah this is the thing with courseplay in FS19, performance goes away.
</p>

<p>
Oh btw, still no fertilizing contracts... in fact I'll stop talking about them now until the next one shows up that I accept.
</p>

<p>
1444 Finished cultivating F57, contract, collected contract reward 37.9k.<br>
1459 Accepted contract for cultivating F32<br>
1502 Started cultivating F32, contract.<br>
1617 Finished cultivating F31, contract, collected contract reward 26.4k.<br>
1658 Finished cultivating F32, contract, collected contract reward 22.7k. Budget now 288.1k
</p>

<p>
Decided that what the heck this career is pretty bad as it is so lets do something I normally wouldn't do, lets take some harvest contracts and use courseplay to drive both vehicles where I'm only doing the combine unloading manually.
</p>

<p>
1722 Accepted contract for harvesting F52<br>
1730 Accepted contract for harvesting F55<br>
1740 Finished cultivating F28, contract, collected contract reward 55.1k. Budget now 343.3k<br>
1743 Started harvesting canola F55, contract. Courseplay duration <b>27 HOURS 22min !</b> :-)<br>
1744 Started harvesting barley F52, contract. Courseplay duration <b>19 HOURS 1min !</b><br>
1948 Accepted contract for cultivating F54<br>
1959 Started cultivating F54, contract. Courseplay duration 11h 15min.
</p>

<p>
2000 Finally a fertilizing contract appeared, F25 which is 74.1ha and reward 146.5k, its about damn time...<br>
2002 Accepted contract for fertilizing F25<br>
</p>

<p>
Leased semi truck and low boy so I can transport the rubicon quicker. Then leased rubicon 9000 for usual 25k something. After a short while I decided to save the courseplay courses for harvesters, well big mistake as F55's course which was 51k waypoints caused FS19 to, well not technically crash but yeah basically it crashed. Even loading the last savegame with that 5mb xml course file in the dir caused FS19 to freeze, had to delete it. I learned long time ago with FS17 that you do not save a very large courseplay courses, why I tried to do that now is beyond understanding. Oh well. Fixed it and back to farming.
</p>

<p>
2054 Started fertilizing F25, contract.<br>
? Finished fertilizing F25, contract, collected contract reward 146.5k. Budget now 448k.<br>
</p>

<p>
I was on the background when fertilizing contract finished, also now there is one weeding contract, no relation for fert/spray stuff but anyways regarding weeds.
</p>

<p>
Anyways seems like now I have moment to breathe and must say those harvesting contracts with courseplay duration are pretty crazy, I mean 27 hours is ... wow heh. More than one day straight and thats assuming the harvester would move forward constantly which it obviously is not going to do, it will stop each time it gets full because I cant be there with a trailer to unload it all the time.
</p>

<p>
2222 Drove leased vehicles back to vehicle shop and returned them, no contracts so lets not waste money.<br>
2339 Leased krone zx 560 gd loading wagon and valtra t234 tractor so I can pickup straw from F52 harvest.
</p>

<p>
No idea how worth the effort is it to pickup the straw, especially with leased vehicles. But I know that there will be so much straw that I probably lose interest before anything heh. So if the straw market prices is like 100-150 or maybe a bit more, dunno, we'll see if I can even get the money back for these leased equipment.
</p>

<p>
2348 Started to collect straw from F52... except I got the <i>you have no access to this land</i> display, uh oh forgot all about that, oh well guess I'm not going to be doing any straw stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-18T0105</b> Its been now well over 12hrs in-game time without time acceleration (so, same as real time? hehe) and still no changes on how contracts are generated, so much for the idea of time acceleration bugging the large terrain setup. Oh well was worth the shot.<br>
0249 Accepted contract for fertilizing F72, F74 and F79
</p>

<p>
Finally batch of three smallish fertilizing contracts. Leased the same setup, a semi truck, low boy and rubicon. Time to get to work.
</p>

<p>
0302 Started fertilizing F72, contract.<br>
0307 Accepted contract for cultivating F40
</p>

<p>
F40 contract was a joke, it will probably crash courseplay or take DAYS to cultivate, but who cares haha. In fact I'm not even going to bother trying to generate courseplay course, I'm going to drive small outlines areas and do the field in several pieces, courseplay would never work with single course for 2873ha field, never. Also the case ih will run out of fuel before the field is cultivated. However when I accepted the contract FS19 froze for close to 10min which was odd, previously I accepted fertilizing contract just fine.
</p>

<p>
BTW interesting that when I tried to accept F40 contract FS19 froze, I had to kill it and restore game from savegame. Just before that happened I got fertilizing contract for F48 which I accepted, however after loading the savegame... F48 contract did not come up. Hmm odd.
</p>

<p>
0341 Accepted contract for weeding F11, hey it was just next to the vehicle shop and with courseplay just hands free money in the bank.<br>
0350 Leased mahindra retriever limited edition so I can do the F40 courseplay outlines.<br>
0348 Started weeding F11, contract.<br>
0408 Started cultivating F40 south 1. Courseplay duration 8h and this is only about less than 10 percent of the southern area hehe<br>
0410 Finished fertilizing F72, contract, collected contract reward 109k.<br>
0417 Started fertilizing F74, contract.<br>
0500 Finished fertilizing F74, contract, collected contract reward 109k. Budget now 568.5k<br>
0509 Started fertilizing F79, contract.<br>
0541 Finished fertilizing F79, contract, collected contract reward 108k. Budget now 676.6k

<p>
Had FS19 freeze on me, was really thankful that I just minutes earlier done savegame. When I restarted the game courseplay field scanner got stuck on F40 for very long time, several minutes. wonder whats going on with F40 now and does it have to do something with that running contract.
</p>

<p>
0638 Finished weeding F11, contract, collected contract reward 13.1k. Wow all that work and 13k hehe (yeah not work at all, just courseplay).<br>
0639 Dead tired, it was time to call it a night. More farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
1417 Back at PMC Gaming, lets continue the large harvest.<br>
1459 Returned leased semi truck, low boy and rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
Because of the lack of fertilizing contracts and me wasting so much time trying to get this Start From Zero to gain some momentum, I decided to try something else I normally would not do on top of these crazy harvest contracts, that is so called land flipping. That is me checking out what land lot contains a lucrative crop field ready to harvest like canola or soybeans, buy the land, harvest the field and then sell the land. I have seen some people call this an exploit, I don't like it in general because that is not simulating farming, you would not do that in real life. But now I'm going to try it out, just to see how it works, is it like huge amount of money or just equal to average fertilizing contract.
</p>

<p>
1621 Purchased land lot with 284.1k, leased trailer 3.9k, truck 6k, combine 20.4k, header 4.1k<br>
1651 Started harvesting exploit canola F34 :)<br>
1725 Finished cultivating F54, contract, collected contract reward 114.8k. Budget now 485.8k
</p>

When the time came to sell first canola load from F34 the market price in selling point 8 had plummeted, it was actually the second lowest in the market. I really didn't want to start driving all the way to the other side of the terrain for best price, which even that wasn't too good, so I decided to just go to selling point 8 which is the closest one. And as you can see below, exploit canola even with the low low price gets me over one hundred grand per load and I imagine there will be <i>a few</i> loads from 55ha field even with it being poorly grown crop (no fert or lime and weeds growing).
</p>

<p>
1802 Sold canola for 102.5k<br>
1846 Sold canola for 92.8k, oh wow now selling point 8 IS the lowest market price of them all. Hmm maybe I need to drive to the best price after all...<br>
1934 Sold canola for 85k<br>
2017 Fertilizing contracts appeared, still cant believe how few of them there have been.<br>
2019 Accepted contract for fertilizing F71 and F76<br>
2021 Purchased rubicon 9000 with guidance steering, lizard roadrunner truck, low boy. Budget now 47.3k<br>
2030 Accepted contract for fertilizing F46
</p>

<p>
So finally managed to buy my very own first vehicle, got the low boy to carry that beast rubicon to the lucrative fertilizing contracts. All I need now is the tanker trailer so I can haul some fertilizer as well. That have to wait until few contracts have been done, or well, looking at the rewards... just one :)
</p>

<p>
Feeling good now that this career has taken off that there are no more time acceleration boring to death waiting. Sure there still could be if I want to get those specific contracts, but what money I get from these contracts I can already buy my first own land, I really need a fuel station and liquid fertilizer refill point. Maybe, just maybe with leased vehicles I could seed my first own field too, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
2043 Started fertilizing F46, contract.<br>
2047 Another load from exploit canola field was ready for sale, but uh oh selling point 8 market price had completely went bad, it was mere 656 right now when the best price in selling point 2 is 2113. Yeah, guess where I'm driving huh.<br>
2100 Sold canola for 124.6k<br>
2113 Accepted contract for fertilizing F39<br>
2114 Finished cultivating F40 south 1. Now I have to record new outline for south 2 heh.<br>
2132 Started cultivating F40 south 2.<br>
2145 Purchased UTTS-32000 tanker trailer for 58k<br>
2207 Accepted contract for fertilizing F07 and F25<br>
2209 Accepted contract for spraying F41, F43 and F48<br>
2246 Switched plant growth to slow, just in case it would help to slow the contracts rotation.<br>
2319 Sold canola for 120.4k<br>
2320 Finished fertilizing F46, contract, collected contract reward 262.4k.

<b>2019-07-19T0012</b> Started fertilizing F76, contract.<br>
0052 Leased second rubicon 9000.<br>
0105 Started fertilizing F71, contract.<br>
0116 Sold canola for 96.8k<br>

0226 Sold back the land flipping land, budget now 646k.<br>
0232 Purchased liquid fertilizer tank for 8.5k<br>
0236 Sold canola for 99.1k
</p>

<p>
So the total exploit from the land flipping purchase and canola harvest was 721.2k in sold canola. Then you need to deduct the lease price for lizard warrior truck, krampe trailer, john deere S790 and macdon fd75 header, dunno actually how much those are total with the hourly fees and such.
</p>

<p>
I was considering keeping the leased vehicles but sort of wanted to get rid of the exploit evidence and returned those right away hehe :)
</p>

<p>
0241 Returned leased harvest equipment.<br>
0317 Finished fertilizing F76, contract, collected contract reward 613.8k. Budget now 1.286m, I'm a millionaire, yeah buddy! :)<br>

0743 Dead tired, been up way more than 16hrs today (16hrs timer went off like ages ago heh), time for shut eye, more farming tomorrow...
</p>

<p>
1738 Back to farming, lets see what great stuff we can do today.<br>
1754 Courseplay field scanner takes more than 10min to do F40 now that it has active contract (whatever that means).<br>
</p>

<p>
When I checked contracts menu first time today, three of my spraying contracts were completed, one was even huge over 300k one. Now the odd thing is that... I did <i>not</i> complete them, heck I didn't even start them yet! Hmm bug in the v1.4.1 engine or in my terrain or whats going on? Could that be the contract expiring and some new v1.4.1 engine feature to just give the money for the player anyways?
</p>

<p>
I have suffered so much with the non existant fertilizing contracts that while this money I got now (like close to half a million) is due to some sort of a bug, I will not refuse the money because I didn't cheat anything, if the game contract system wants to give me money from the contracts without me even starting them, hey I'll thank kindly and move on hehe ;)
</p>

<p>
1821 Finished fertilizing F39, contract, collected contract reward 262.7k.<br>
1851 Finished fertilizing F25, contract, collected contract reward 146.5k. Budget now 3.150m<br>
1854 Returned the another leased rubicon 9000 as there are no more fertilizing contracts.<br>
1937 Finished cultivating F40 south 2.<br>
1953 Recorded F40 outline south 3 course.<br>
1954 Started cultivating F40 south 3.
</p>

<p>
As an experiement I took one spraying contract for F79, I am not going to do it as it only pays 87.5k and I'm too lazy to drive my huge fertilizer rig down there and especially as I would need to buy some herbicide (I don't have dedicated herbicide sprayer rubicon yet). Now its interesting to see when hours pass by that will this contract also be awarded to me for no reason other than me taking it. I'm hoping it just gets cancelled, but wouldnt be surprised if I get the reward again. Lets see what happens.
</p>

<p>
I decided to try another unusual thing, unplanned rather, I leased another truck, trailer, tractor, auger wagon and two combines. These I'm going to use to help speed up the two harvest contracts. I drove them to F55 first as its higher reward, drove a new courseplay course for the truck to selling point 5, then started the combines from south end of the field as multiple tools mode. I didn't write play-by-play with times (its now 2056hrs) because I wasn't sure my own leased vehicles work on contract field which already has "borrowed" vehicles. Edit: they work fine, just checking.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-20T0158</b> Accepted contract for fertilizing F36 and F37<br>
0212 Started fertilizing F36, contract.<br>
</p>

<p>
36 and 37 werent the biggest fields, moderate amount of reward for those contracts, but the nice thing was that they were right next to each other. With the crazy fertilizing contract mayhem its funny how 100k reward one feels insignificant heh.
</p>

<p>
0248 Finished fertilizing F36, contract, collected contract reward 110.3k. Started fertilizing F37, contract.<br>
0332 Finished fertilizing F37, contract, collected contract reward 110.3k. Budget now 3.101m
</p>

<p>
F55 was getting done nicely, then the 3d world green display indicator on top right corner of the screen shows 100 percent complete after which I started to receive the cash... BUT the contracts menu still shows like 95 percent done and increasing on every load dump, heh odd, but I'll take the money :)
</p>

<p>
Also the normal harvest contract method is to do the field to the last piece of crop and sell them to the highest bidder, so makes no difference to me really.
</p>

<p>
0554 Dumped yet another load to selling point 5 from F55, and STILL the contract progress said 99 percent heh. The progress seem to lag behind what happens in 3D world, I also got some setShaderParameter errors in the log, been running the game all day so it might be pretty bogged down, FPS is still normal etc.<br>
0559 Now finally got the green notification text about F55 contract being finished, heh. So now harvest continues and I'll sell the grain for my own pocked.<br>
0613 Sold canola in selling point 8 for 134.2k<br>

0906 Dead tired and even though I have exciting times in-game, had to call it a night, cant keep my eyes open, Zzz...
</p>

<p>
1443 Back at PMC Gaming computer, its time to fertilize fields and make a ton of money.<br>
1450 First time after loading a savegame checked contracts and sure enough the spraying contract had expired and I got the money from it.
</p>

<p>
Already felt the pressure to do these fertilizing contracts so that they will not expire, nothing worse than doing some useless stuff (like barley harvest heh) and when you finally get to that hundreds of thousands paying contract... its expired. I'm going to stop harvesting barley in F52 contract, purchase another fertilizing rig and get to work.
</p>

<p>
1621 Purchased lizard roadrunner truck, low boy, UTTS-32000 tanker trailer, dolly and rubicon 9000 with guidance steering. And the next thing after that FS19 locked up so that audio was playing but game was frozen, I've had that happen once before so this is troubling trend...
</p>

<p>
Then restarted the game and had to wait frigging 15min or so for the courseplay field scanner to get bogged down on F40. All I can hope that my last savegame wasn't very far before this lockup. I have saves disabled due the annoying save and delay especially when capturing a video, people like nothing more than several "saving game ..." displays to watch on videos. Guess its time to activate the 15min autosave again if there will be more of these lockups.
</p>

<p>
1647 Back in-game, savegame is fairly recent probably not more that few minutes old, so we're good.<br>
1655 Had purchased the above mentioned set, once again, this time also saved game after so if there is another lockup we don't need to do this the third time heh<br>
1701 Finished fertilizing F39, contract, collected contract reward 262.7k. Budget now 3.449m<br>

1714 Started fertilizing F76, contract.<br>
1737 Started fertilizing F46, contract.
</p>

<p>
Got another 100k fertilizing contract but I didn't take it yet, as with F53 I suspect there might be some sort of bug or whatever issue with multiple missions mod and contracts that if you spam too many of them, then you start to get those you have no access to this land. Also I'm not sure taking all those contracts in any way guarantees that they wont disappear on you over time, so you might as well just take them one by one for each vehicle you have available.
</p>

2219 Due to outside real life interference had to restart my game. Now I have to reboot everything back up and suffer through that 15min courseplay F40 field scan again, SIGH.
</p>

<p>
2251 FS19 started up again, lets get all the courseplay courses running, hrr...<br>

<b>2019-07-21T0007</b> Game locked up again, damn, what is going on here...<br>
0027 Savegame loaded back up, actually took one just less than a minute before the freeze so that was good. Reverted to yesterdays courseplay version, no indication that these freezes are caused by it but just had a hunch gut feeling so decided to give it a try.<br>
0037 With this game start and savegame load the 849.3k spraying contract was rewarded to me. Yep, another bug and exploit discovered.<br>
0153 Harvesting F52 contract was done, now its time to sell the grain to my own pocked in best market price :)<br>
0207 Sold barley in selling point 7 for 73.7k<br>
0217 Two truck loads went to selling point 7 and I didn't even notice the stupid small green right corner notification text hehe, budget now 5.883m<br>
0223 Sold barley in selling point 7 for 73.7k<br>
0234 Sold barley in selling point 7 for 73.7k<br>
0240 Finished harvesting barley F52, contract.<br>
0243 Sold barley in selling point 7 for 73.7k<br>
0246 Barley harvest on F52 collected contract reward 353.4k. Canola harvest on F55 collected contract reward 548.7k. Budget now 6.984m :)<br>
</p>

<p>
So there you go, the two huge harvest contracts are now complete. I started with 27hrs and 19hrs courseplay durations with single combines, then lateron the next day or something brought in more vehicles to speed the process up. Here we are now, both contracts done, also all fertilizing contracts done.
</p>

<p>
I got hmm total of three spraying contract rewards for nothing as they are buggy, also flipped that one land canola harvest so this Start From Zero is not exactly by the book, I don't feel especially proud of the land flipping and the third spraying contract I took knowingly and just to assure that yes it is bugged.
</p>

<p>
But we cant forget the endless darkness madness that was in the early days when time accelerating waiting for lucrative contracts, so its not like I went and used money cheats here.
</p>

<p>
0253 Right now I'm going to take a break for today, I could go on but I rather take a nice break in such good situation on the savegame and tomorrow I'll see how I feel about continuing.
</p>

<p>
2037 Back to farming. Added new farmer_schubi (class name fixes by me) production mods and some fast peterbilt truck. Lets see what happens.<br>
2038 Purchased peterbilt 379 freedom for 160k<br>
2049 Started cultivating F40 outline south 4.<br>
2103 Purchased land lot with F39 in it for 709.8k<br>
2110 Purchased PMC Farm Bin Large 10m liters and landscaped a bit, budget now 5.925m<br>
2158 Restarted game because forgot to add all production mods in.<br>
2201 Purchased diesel, fertilizer and seed production for 225k each. Purchased liquid fertilizer production for 125k<br>
2216 Purchased water station for 5k<br>
2221 Another restart for missing manure and slurry placeables.<br>
2224 Purchased manure shop for 7.5k and slurry shops for 15k<br>
2226 Purchased trailer krampe for 78k<br>
2228 Purchased ideal 9t combine with guidance steering and engine upgrade for 534k<br>
2229 Purchased header 13.7m macdon FD75 for 82k<br>
2253 Purchased trailer full of manure for 2.5k to be used in production.<br>
2337 Purchased lizard mks 32 tanker trailer for 68k<br>
2356 Refilled 32k liters of water for free, then loaded liquid fertilizer production factory :)
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-22T0009</b> Filled lime production factory with water :)<br>
</p>

<p>
When playing on FS17 Cornbelt on its Start From Scratch (it was called scratch back then) career I just absolutely loved the fuel, fertilizer and seed factory stuff (along with the railroads to do logistic stuff). Now when I got these farmer_schubi production placeables in action I felt similar excitement when my own products were produced.
</p>

<p>
I feel that the lime production is a bit too fast, you can barely go pickup water tanker full of water when the previous load has already been produced into lime, but maybe its just me. Also fertilizer production in Cornbelt required two components which was manure and slurry, now you can do it with only manure. And of course we are still missing herbicide factory, but hopefully someone comes up with that.
</p>

<p>
Oh right farmer_schubi as so many other modders did these nice mods with german language, sigh, so I went and translated the display table textures to english (wont be releasing that fix as got no permissions and someone else already did a translation).
</p>

<p>
0352 Game restart to load my display table texture edits mentioned above.<br>
</p>

<p>
Combine harvester and truck trailer was already bought for the upcoming harvest, but after that I'm lacking equipment so here is a shopping list I plan to get:
</p>

<p>
0442 Started to purchase that long list of new toys.<br>
0501 All purchased and slowly moving them to the farm. Budget now 2.159m<br>
0515 Accepted contract for fertilizing F66<br>
0536 Started fertilizing F66, contract.<br>
0608 Finished fertilizing F66, contract, collected contract reward 109.3k.<br>
0614 Purchased another ideal 9t combine with macdon fd75 header. Budget now 1.635m<br>
0738 Fertilizer and lime factories are full of resource material heh<br>
</p>

<p>
Now that fertilizer and lime factories are humming, I wonder how long it will take to expend all that product to my fields, I mean one million liters is respectable amount of stuff :)
</p>

<p>
Not that I have much fields yet but eventually when the farm grows as more hectares get added, I cant estimate but a wild guess is that one million liters lasts a very long time. Not to mention the factory always produces more as long as I remember to dump some resource material there. This is really the large scale farming stuff, especially when I install those fertilizer/lime/seed bins into strategic locations around the terrain which act like remote outposts for refills.
</p>

<p>
0830 At in-game time 0416hrs F39 became harvest ready, time to cut that soybeans off my first own field :)<br>
0832 Started harvesting soybeans F39<br>
0933 So tired had to call it a night, more farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
1724 Back at PMC Gaming fired up FS19, lets continue farming.<br>
1729 When I loaded savegame today the F40 contract shows 0 percent complete, hmm... thats not good. But luckily the progress bar was just lagging behind as it very quickly increased the number and kept increasing until it was on the correct number again. Anyways still odd.<br>
2113 Had to take a break for a quick nap, could not keep my eyes open...
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-07-23T0023</b> Woke up, had a meal and now started FS19 back up. Lets continue harvesting.<br>
</p>

<p>
This Start From Zero had a rocky start, then some guestionable business practices (heh) but now we are here and I realized... I skipped all the starter vehicles and went straight to the biggest tractors and implements. Hmm this is not how from zero stuff should work...
</p>

<p>
Well true but also I have no desire to do some crazy 6 hrs harvesting session with that bizon tiny 2m header harvester either. I just cant seem to be satisfied no matter what I do; get the best vehicles right away and its too easy, have to use starter kit and its too hard haha ;)
</p>

<p>
Oh well. But yeah the scenario I'm right now almost feels like the starting moment of normal Farm Manager mode where you get no vehicles but 1.5 million in cash (including the loan you can take yourself). Dunno man I really love this from zero idea, it really gives you sense of satisfaction when you know that everything you own is by your hard work, nothing has been given to you.
</p>

<p>
But still I'm thinking deep thoughts here... is this from zero stuff too insane regarding wasted time in a game that already is such an time sink. Hmm maybe the adjustment for this game mode would be in order, that you start with nothing and have the ability to take 1 million loan, which would obviously mean that you'd take all of the money and start working on your farm right away buying land etc, then just pay the loan off later. This would be interesting and enjoyable game-play right from the beginning instead of sitting in time acceleration waiting for specific contracts which bring you the best money.
</p>

<p>
Indeed deep thoughts man...
</p>

<p>
Anyways lets get back to everyday business. I need to start making money and buying fields, the end goal here is to buy all the lands and harvest all the fields. So right now I'm looking for my next land to buy. Not cheating, but still searching for soybean or canola fields on the land so when I buy there is lucrative crop waiting for me to harvest, often times the money got from the harvested crop already comes close to the paying price of the land (havent done extensive comparisons but roughly its like that).
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of just looking for closest canola or soybean field not necessarily buy land around my F39 farm symmetrically like spreading out evenly. Obviously I'm not going to buy soybean field from other side of the terrain I have no desire to relocate my harvest fleet there, but closest ones yes.
</p>

<p>
0123 Finished harvesting soybeans F39, aayeah my first very own field! :)<br>
0133 All the grain dumped into farm bin silo, total amount 1.107.419 liters from F39, I believe it was fully fertilized and no lime/plow requirements.<br>
0147 Started fertilizing F39, courseplay duration 1h 19min<br>
0153 Purchased land lot which has F38 for 756.4k, budget now 850.1k<br>
</p>

<p>
F38 is right next to my farm, actually right next to my existing F39, its also harvest ready oats which I can use for my seed factory. I really want to kick off making my own seeds. I bought this field for the crops to be used in seed factory, no other reason. Next lands I'll try to buy with most profitable crops growing like canola or soybeans.
</p>

<p>
0207 Started harvesting oats F38<br>
0208 Finished cultivating F40 outline south 4.<br>
0224 Started cultivating F40 outline north 1.<br>
0303 Seed factory already had 15.5k liters of seed produced, pretty much enough for one seeding with seed hawk.<br>
0309 Finished fertilizing F39<br>
0639 Finished harvesting oats F38
</p>

<p>
Felt pretty good getting that oat field harvested and seed factory humming, already got a good load of seeds I cannot imagine running out of them anytime soon, the real problem will be how to haul that stuff to the fields across the terrain, but lets worry about that when we actually get those remote fields hehe :)

2202 Soybeans market price in selling point 8 is now the highest, 3078 vs 3094 and increasing, so I switched my transport grain route accordingly.<br>
</p>

<p>
I sold a lot of soybeans before selling point 8 price started to increase, at the time of writing this its already 3138 which is really good (my high score record is 3304). Hopefully the price increases to record high again, still have about two hundred thousand liters to sell.
</p>

<p>
2251 Finished fertilizing F38
</p>

<p>
I made a list of growing or harvest ready soybean fields: 15, 30, 31, 41, 48, 72 and 79. I can basically rule out 72 and 79 as they are other side of the terrain, way too long distance to relocate my harvesting fleet. 30 is monster size and I don't have money for it. Rest... well 15 is nice, relatively big and pretty close, 48 is also big but at the east side of the terrain. So all in all, I would most probably buy F15.
</p>

<p>
For canola; 27, 11, 21, 55 and 81. Lets rule out 81 straight off the bat as its almost the other side of the terrain, 55 unfortunaely is on a bad farmland ID painting land lot which costs huge 10.9m (my bad, will be fixed in the future). That leaves us with a big 21 as the two others are pretty small.
</p>

<p>
We can't forget that this is very short sighted thing, choosing a land to purchase only of what its growing is only worth for one harvest, so its not very smart to purchase land lot in the other side of the terrain if you only benefit for it one time, you probably waste more money on fuel costs driving your vehicles back and forth there not to mention the wasted time in the long run heh.
</p>

<p>
Hmm but I'm lazy, I just want to get farming... so I'm thinking of buying land next to my farm as there is this nice group of land/fields which would only cost total of 2.4m so I even had a bit buffer money left. Hmm. Except... here are sunflowers and corn fields then all rest of them are crap potatoes, ugh. That would mean a lot of plowing stuff under.

Seed hawk is sitting by the field ready to go, except I don't want to start it off because it doesn't have enough seeds and my seed tender haulmaster auger wagon is tied up with the corn harvest. I need to buy another tractor and haulmaster just to take care of the seed hawk (in the future seed hawkS plural, once I get some more money).

2309 Saved and exited game, got to try one mod out quickly before continuing.
</p>

	<h2>PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 Upgrade</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-10-22T1605</b> After a months long break I'm back at PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero career :)
</p>

<p>
Terrain itself was upgraded to v0.1.3 which includes trains, five of them I think and train grain depots. Each train has hmm dunno how many cars with 143k liter capacity per car. Each train depot holds 10 million liters of grain per crop type, including fertilizer, lime and seeds.
</p>

<p>
It took me a long time to fiddle with the career savegame XML files to port the old savegame over to new terrain with trains and train depots.
</p>

<p>
Another extremely important news is that I upgraded this savegame to <b>Seasons</b> v1.0.1.8 beta ie build 34 from yesterday. So now the whole game-play has changed as we work with seasons. This causes a lot of grief porting over the old savegame but I managed to do it more or less properly.
</p>

<p>
What I'm planning on doing is using dev console cheat commands to set F34, F38 and F39 to their growth and fertilization etc stages, other fields can be just resetted to simple harvested state by Seasons mod.
</p>

<p>
Only bummer was that there was no easy way (way that it would be worth it) to port over the F40 cultivation contract, I just simply cancelled it. In theory I could have restored the cultivator_density.gdm but that is way beyond whats wort bothering to.
</p>

<p>
1621 Alright launched the career savegame in purpose of actually starting to play. There still are few things I need to wrap up in the porting, but almost there.
</p>

<p>
Seasons is configured as 24 day season. I have previously played on another savegame in PMC Grande Gardens 16km using 24 day season and it worked well, in that savegame progress I did not run out of time/days when doing fieldwork. There sure are a lot of time accelerating going on, but its better to have more time than you need as you never know when something comes up.
</p>

1858 Had to refill UTTS-32000 tanker with liquid fertilizer, rubicon is running low<br>
2014 Finished fertilizing F33
</p>

<p>
2017 Getting really tired been up more than 16hrs, time for some shut eye but more farming tomorrow thats for sure, cant wait.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-23T0406</b> Back in FS19, lets farm this sucka.
</p>

<p>
0407 Started lime spreading F33, courseplay ETA 6h 43min, whoah six almost seven hours heh wow<br>
0426 Started cultivating F35, courseplay ETA 1h 47min
</p>

<p>
That lime spreading is crazy, I need more vehicles to split the time so going to buy at least one more bredal and dedicated medium tractor for it (or such jobs).
</p>

<pre>
- spreader bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit for 76k
- tractor case 240 with guidance steering and twin wheels 231.5k
</pre>
<p>
0450 Purchased the above setup, budget now 1.460m.
</p>

<p>
Drove the case 240 cvx to the "farm", topped up with lime and then drove to F33. Started to help courseplay AI driver by using gps on the north end of the field working my way down south.
</p>

<p>
Big Bud 450 with John Deere 2410 5 section cultivator courseplay finished the course, but for some odd reason courseplay left small patches at each end of the field which I had to fix manually driving. Maybe its the new settings behind advanced options.
</p>

<p>
0623 Finished cultivating F35
</p>

<p>
Was driving case 240 cvx with bredal k165 spreader using GPS, then had to step outside for about half an hour (might have been longer from keyboard perspective) so I copied courseplay course from the main lime spreader and set off my tractor from the other end of the course.
</p>

<p>
0809 Finished lime spreading F33
</p>

<p>
Finally done lime spreading, wow it took a long time with two tractors (one at the beginning). Man I've almost forgotten what madness PMC Grande Gardens 16km terrain field sizes field work is hehe.
</p>

<p>
0810 As soon as I wrote the above and drove lime spreading tractor off the field, tried to change into rubicon 9000... FS19 froze, ZOC! :(
</p>

<p>
Reloaded the game from savegame and uh oh still had several rows of lime spreading to do in that save :(
</p>

<p>
This could be one of the things that makes me ultimately stop playing on (PMC Grande Gardens) 16km terrain as how could you enjoy game-play when it could freeze at any moment?
</p>

<p>
During my other career savegame I tried to track down the issue but had no luck, I don't know what causes the freeze. Logical conclusion is some sort of memory limit or performance whatever bogging that 16km terrain is just too large for this piece of crap FS19 engine to handle.
</p>

<p>
For this savegame and most likely to all other 16km terrain saves, I set the auto-safe frequency to 5min. Its painful with 16km terrain file sizes when it saves that stuff often and causes delay on ESC menu, but its more annoying when you lose a lot of progress due game freeze for no reason.
</p>

<p>
0834 Started fertilizing F33, courseplay ETA 2h 6min
</p>

<p>
While the lone rubicon is spraying I decided to go pick up the lowboy trailer with another rubicon from other side of the terrain, I sold the crap mod freedom truck because it gave errors. I guess there is need for a new truck but I'm in cheapo mode and decided to go pick up the lowboy rig with my existing one, its not like this truck has anything better to do while rubicon is working two hours on F33.
</p>

<p>
0912 Arrived with the truck and lowboy, but when unloading rubicon and switching to it FS19 froze, again. Luckily this time I had neurotic savegame frequency.<br>
0918 Restored savegame, started first rubicon on courseplay, switched to second and started to refill from LSFM universal tank fertilizer... and ZOC, freeze.<br>
0928 Finally got both rubicons under one courseplay course, now I'll just let them run without touching the keyboard to get some progress done.<br>
1016 Finished fertilizing F33
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 1800hrs it started to become dark, after parking rubicons next to F35 it was time acceleration time until next morning daylight.
</p>

<p>
1025 Started fertilizing F35, courseplay ETA 19min, 2x tools<br>
1047 Finished fertilizing F35
</p>

<p>
Looks like everything is done that I can do with these fields owned. Next thing to happen is weather ground temperature needs to increase so I can cheat command plant the canola, sunflowers and soybeans that were lost in savegame / seasons porting.
</p>

<p>
Also regular seeding of canola and corn need more temperature. Weather forecast predicts very cold weather even several days from now which is fine, 24 day season so I got all the time in the world (with these fields).
</p>

<p>
1131 Took a small break<br>
1337 Back, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
So now we time accelerate until weather is warm enough for us to cheat-seed and properly seed :)
</p>

<p>
03/early-spring in-game 0712hrs some weed patches start to appear in my fields, have to keep an eye on those if they need spraying.<br>
08/early-spring in-game 1526hrs weather forecast now shows above +6C even minimum temperatures so once the soil warms up to that, then it shouldn't drop below anymore so I'm good to go with canola seeding and cheat cmd planting.<br>
09/early-spring in-game 0320hrs soil temperature hit +6C, alright.
</p>

<p>
Fast forwarded to the morning daylight, checked weather forecast and it looks good, lowest temperature is for today right now in fact +8C and it just gets warmer from here. Okay lets plant those cheat cmd canolas and break out Big Bud 747 with Seed Hawk for some canola seeding.
</p>

<p>
1409 Dev console cheat command planted germinated, 100% fertilized, weeded, limed and plowed canola to F39 just as it was before savegame porting.<br>
1412 Started seeding canola F33, courseplay ETA 5h 18min
</p>

<p>
Five hours of seeding hehe, wonder how many refills does it take, better get that fendt 1050 with elmers haulmaster stocked up with seeds.
</p>

<p>
My budget is 1.460m so there is plenty of money to buy another seed hawk setup to speed up seeding, but as said I'm still on the cheapo mode here and I want to be cautious with my investments. Once the next harvest is done I'll be rolling in money heh. Hopefully this is last of such extremely long field works, I mean 5hrs is a lifetime gaming wise... its just ridiculous time to sit and wait tractor driving back and forth in a field...
</p>

<p>
The important thing to remember is that I cant do anything else, the cheat cmd plants for soybeans and sunflowers are not possible due soil temperature, same goes for the corn proper seeding for the other fields. Yeah I guess I could herbicide spray... but honestly dunno if thats even necessary yet. All I can really do is sit, wait and watch seed hawk going around and around... for five hours.
</p>

<p>
I really should have just bought two more seed hawk setups to cut this time, its just not sane to play video game like this where you cannot do anything but watch and honestly the watching after first about 10-15min... is for nothing, yeah big bud driving around in a field, so? hehe
</p>

<p>
Anyways I have been ranting about farmsim being a huge time sink and especially a waste of my valuable editing time, so this is nothing new. Okay, back to watching big bud drive around...
</p>

<p>
1619 First refill of seed hawk seeds<br>
1748 Took a quick break to watch Adventures of Ford Fairlane 1080p bluray movie :)<br>
1824 Second refill of seed hawk seeds<br>
1937 Finished seeding canola F33
</p>

<p>
Finally the five hour seeding was done, uuh. It was time for me to call it a night, assuming and hoping I'll continue tomorrow enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-24T0515</b> FS19 started up, lets do some farming.
</p>

<p>

16/mid-spring over night soil temperature warmed up to +10C, I'm ready for corn and soybeans seeding.
</p>

<p>
0904 Cheat command planted soybeans to F38 just as it was before savegame porting.<br>
0906 Purchased seeder 325hp 27m john deere db90 322.1k
</p>

<p>
That DB90 planter was pretty expensive, budget now 1.053m. After filling it up I realized its capacity is only 3523 liters for seeds, not sure if I'm ruined by seed hawk but that amount feels ridiculously low, I bet it will be dozen refills even for 50ha field hehe. Of course no laughing matter if corn planting will be so painful but yeah.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to check out the DB120 planter after next harvest maybe it has more capacity, it should but who knows. Of course down the line when my operations grow larger, I'm going to get maybe fleet of 4 of these planters, that gives you some high capacity.
</p>

<p>
0926 Started seeding corn F36, courseplay ETA 1h 34min<br>
0940 Headland was done and 91 liters of seeds left, haha
</p>

<p>
0946 Was pissed off, went and loaded up elmers haulmaster with 70k liters of seeds, should be enough for these two fields.
</p>

<p>
1017 DB90 had done like two rows and already had to refill it twice, I was extremely frustrated and already googled "the best" corn planter.
</p>

<p>
1104 Uuh I'm dying here, the hell if I'm gonna do the other field with this garbage planter haha, I'm going to try DB120 next and it it sucks then I'll just get two maybe even four default giants great plains planters which has 5800 liter capacity so they have a lot of endurance for courseplay use.
</p>

<p>
1159 Finished seeding corn F36<br>
</p>

<p>
1206 Started to seed corn to F35 because there was still 2700 liters of seeds left in this DB90 crap. Plan is to go swap this to DB120.<br>
</p>

<p>
1224 Purchased seeder john deere db120 for 472k, sold john deere for 255.8k, budget now 837.3k
</p>

<p>
Damn where have my millions gone? heh, yep if you buy a planter and use it a bit, the price drops dramatically. If you need to test out vehicles; LEASE.
</p>

<p>
All the field work is done (assuming no weeds appear). Now we just time accelerate until our crops grow :)
</p>

<p>
17/late-spring in-game 0707hrs field crop growth stage switched, we have plants growing now, nice.
</p>

<p>
I was walking around my fields (ok running as the fields are so large), got into one high spot where I can see three fields at once, I was in north east corner of F36 with nice small corn plants growing. It was so nice to stand there in those fully fertilized fields after all that work I put in them. Those who know the feeling are the true farmsim fanatics :)
</p>

<p>
1639 It was time for a break, did not know how long it will be so shut down PMC Gaming computer just in case.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-25T0335</b> Started up FS19, I think today is harvest day :)
</p>

<p>
0338 Fendt 1050 with elmers haulmaster 2000 has 31k liters of seeds in it, lets go dump those back to seed factory so we have room for grain.<br>
0422 Time accelerating 21/late-spring in-game 0659hrs and F38 is still in germinated state, not growing yet. I'm afraid we're gonna have a problem with F38.<br>
0442 In-game 01/early-summer 0616hrs and field stages are still the same, today is the first day of canola harvest season.<br>
0447 Next time acceleration in-game day 02/early-summer 0635hrs switched growth stage for all fields, F38 growing soybeans, we're all good.<br>
0536 In-game 07/early-summer 1503hrs corn sell price in sell point 1 (very close) is 1512 which is very nice.
</p>

<p>
I think its time to make a courseplay route to sell grain in sell point 1, to make some money out of that 880.5k liters of corn I have in the farm bin silo. Crops are growing so have nothing better to do.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
1919 Alright F33, F37 and F39 canola are now harvest ready, lets get started! :)
</p>

<p>
And of course I need to go switch corn headers at my farm first heh, nice little drive with combines :)
</p>

<p>
Decided to start with F39 as the regular headers were right next to the field and also its by my farm where I will be traveling back and forth many times so better to get it cleared out from the way.
</p>

<p>
1934 Started harvesting canola F39, courseplay ETA 5h 7min, 2x tools<br>

F39 is 131.058 ha in size so its no small field, harvesting it was fun it didn't feel tedious grind at all, I enjoyed it greatly. I'm sure once I finish all my current fields... I wont be feeling the same enjoy hehe
</p>

<p>
So F39 was ported over from older savegame before terrain v0.1.3 and Seasons, this is why I had to use dev console cheat commands (cheat is a dirty word, its just dev console tools to me) to port/restore the field to the stage it was in the old savegame.
</p>

<p>
This field was plowed, limed, 0% weeds and 100% fertilization. The size was as just said 131ha and I harvested this "perfect" canola total of 1,373,611 liters!
</p>

<p>
That is a crazy amount of canola. Now think about that I still have F37 (54.919 ha) and the monster F33 (218.068 ha) left, imagine what my farm bin silo total amount of canola is when all of it will be harvested. Oh wow, I told you I'll be rolling in money :)
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 still do not have train track connection to a sell point so I need to decide if I'm going to haul this insane amount of grain using trucks or will I edit the terrain to add these train sell point connections and then again port over the savegame (which is not easy with seasons). I'm most likely just be lazy, play it safe and haul the grain with trucks.
</p>

<p>
0927 Taking a quick break to cook and eat food now, usually I don't shut down FS19 for such small breaks but now I will.<br>
1054 Food cooked and eaten, FS19 launched back up, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
I started fresh new save with v0.1.3, then copied over terrain.heightmap.png from Start From Zero savegame, loaded fresh save up and with cheat money bought all the lands around my farm and the shop, then terrain landscape sculpted smoothed and leveled all the train track road crossings which were giving me a lot of trouble passing. Saved and copied edited smoothed terrain.heightmap.png back over to Start From Zero savegame.
</p>

<p>
Took 70k liters of canola from the farm bin silo and dumped it to fuel factory, we need fuel. Farm bin silo canola now 1.303 million liters. Too bad the fuel factory counts as bin silo so when I dumped there my canola owned liter count went back up to original number. This means I cant accurately count how many liters of harvest do I get from the other fields, oh well its not that important anyways.
</p>

<p>
Refilled FST 990 with 1200 liter of diesel and drove to refill the combines in F39. Topped off first one but ran out of diesel just before second combine was full.
</p>

<p>
Then drive all the vehicles to F37, drove grain truck route to farm bin silo and we were ready to harvest this field. Had to make combine course with headland because the train tracks are so close by in the north end, combines would collide with train otherwise.
</p>

<p>
1121 Started harvesting canola F37, courseplay ETA 2h 19min, 2x tools<br>
1415 Finished harvesting canola F37
</p>

<p>
Time to take another cooking food lunch break here while shutting down FS19 for the duration (just want to relax and do the chore, then come back).
</p>

<p>
1625 Food got cooked and eaten, now its time to farm. First I need to dump all the harvested canola.
</p>

<p>
Finished dumping all the canola and farm bin silo has now 2,029,000 liters of canola.
</p>

<p>
Next field to harvest is the monster F33 (218.068 ha), that will take me rest of the day and most likely cant finish it before going to sleep tonight. This is also tricky field because grain truck trailer needs to across train tracks and I'm sure it will collide with the train sooner or later, no idea how bad that will end up for the truck and I rather not find out.
</p>

<p>
Decided to test how railroad silo 3 works as its right next to F33 its easy and safe to dump there. So I did dump 25.3k liters there and that grain shows up under "Silos (Other)" tab, nice. I don't actually remember how large the individual railroad silo is but they are very large, probably like ten million liters. Now I can to use the train to haul that grain or just truck to pick it up from the silo itself.
</p>

<p>
1642 Started harvesting canola F33, courseplay ETA 8h 27min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Oh man eight and a half hours of straight up harvesting and that's assuming the combines never stop, also I believe the turns are not calculated only the driving part, so that time is much longer (not sure). Anyways clearly this will continue long into tomorrow, if not more depending how bored I get.
</p>

<p>
My combines need an upgrade too, midwest durus 16.5m headers and at least one more combine probably two.
</p>

<p>
1755 My fridge gave electric spike and messed up windows 7, mouse didn't work. Had to exit and even cold reboot whole computer.<br>
1920 Had to call it quits, something TV related came up so gotta go, more farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-27T0651</b> Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 booted up, lets continue harvesting F33.
</p>

<p>
2x ACGO Ideal 9t combines with macdon FD75 13.7m headers gives me as grain cart driver a lot of downtime, currently as often it is I'm watching youtube farming videos while the combines are filling up. I have more than two million money so I could have easily upgraded my combine fleet but decided to do this field/harvest(?) with these existing ones.
</p>

<p>
I'm undecided if in the upgrade I'm going with Platinum Edition (Claas DLC) lexion 8900 combines with their 18k liter grain tanks, not sure if I can hook up midwest durus 16.5m headers or even the macdons to them, I have not seen any upgrades to those header mods so either they work as-is or ... don't. One thing is for sure, I need the midwest durus wide headers.
</p>

<p>
0841 Had to actually wait for grain truck in my grain cart tractor while two combines were waiting for me. It took a while but grain truck finally got bogged down, need to buy another one to keep the crops flowing to the bin nice and smooth.<br>
0925 Night has fallen, 10/mid-summer in-game 2145hrs, had to turn on lights its getting very dark now, planning on skipping the night when its pitch black.<br>
0932 Cant see combines or grain truck from distance anymore, okay its night skip time. Also will refuel my vehicles while I'll stop them.<br>
</p>

<p>
This is what I love about large terrains and large scale farming, refueling logistics come into play.
</p>

<p>
0940 All done, 11/mid-summer in-game 0629hrs skipped the night and refueled all the vehicles, we are good to go.<br>
1303 Lunch break, decided to exit from FS19 while feeding.<br>
1332 Lunch break over, lets continue farming.<br>
1703 Finished harvesting canola F33
</p>

<p>
I was doing all kind of small stuff on the background while combines were getting full, I will change this setup now by purchasing two more combines with midwest durus monster headers, another grain truck and even the coolamon montherbin to buffer.
</p>

<p>
While F33 harvest was not really painful it still was quite tedious in the end, if I didn't have something to do on the background, like the last two hours or so I was text editing so I could see FS19 screen on the background so that went pretty ok, without it I would have been bored to death.
</p>

<p>
Now I have F38 which is soybeans, that yield is much less than canola, but then F35 and F36 are corn and oh my that will yield like crazy.
</p>

<p>
Refueled all the vehicles again after driving them SW corner of F38. Then I checked how much canola we have in railroad silo 3 and its 2.873 million liters :)
</p>

<p>
I am scared to even think how much farm bin silo 2m and railroad silo 2.8m liters will sell for heh, that is going to be so much money whoah :)
</p>

<p>
1718 Time to take a small break, hopefully wont end playing for today but it just might be, the upcoming soybean harvest is not crazy but I wonder if I could finish it tonight before snoozing off, so we'll see...
</p>

<p>
1832 Started FS19 with Platinum Edition so I can use the Claas DLC vehicles.<br>
1833 Sold macdon FD75 header for 55.7k and 55.5k, sold agco ideal 9t for 400.9k and 400.6k<br>
</p>

<pre>
- harvester claas lexion 8900 18k liter with guidance steering 504.5k
- header 18m midwest durus with colors 169.4k
</pre>
<p>
1837 Purchased 4x the above, budget now 1.009m<br>
</p>

<pre>
- header 12m corn capello quasar hs16 with color 91.2k
</pre>
<p>
1928 Purchased the above times two
</p>

<p>
Leased claas scorpion 1033 telehandler for 4.8k and magsi bale fork for 61, so I can lift the corn headers to low boy in order to transport them to our farm. But that idea failed badly, the telehandler was no way capable of lifting those huge headers haha.
</p>

<p>
Leased rostselmash combine for 15.2k, used it to lift the headers into low boy. Returned the combine right away. Drove the truck with low boy headers into our farm.
</p>

<p>
1951 Sold fuel tank for 2.8k<br>
1952 Purchased coolamon mother bin 100t for 117k<br>
2014 Claas Lexion 8900's and coolamon mother bin are parked next to F38, now we time accelerate for crops to grow.
</p>

<p>
Something weird happened with the leased vehicles, I returned all my leased menu was EMPTY, but I still keep getting 1200 vehicle running costs nightly, I don't get it.
</p>

<p>
Restarted FS19 and now 01/early-autumn in-game 0939hrs fields are ready to harvest, alright.
</p>

<p>
2133 Started harvesting soybeans F38, courseplay ETA 1h 14min, 4x tools<br>
2325 So tired that I'm snoozing off, gotta call it a night here, more farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-28T0535</b> Started FS19 already some time ago but forgot to write it down heh, anyways back to farming, lets get these harvests done.<br>
0605 Finished harvesting soybeans F38
</p>

<p>
First field harvested with new Claas Lexion 8900 with Midwest Durus 18m header on it, I love it. Excellent combine setup :)
</p>

<p>
Why did I harvest F33 with only two combines using 13.7m headers, I do not know... hehe. It is so much nicer with four and with these monster headers which cut half the field in one pass heh.
</p>

<p>
Now we have three corn header fields left.
</p>

<p>
Dumped last load of soybeans, got 837.8k liters total. Nice harvest from one field.
</p>

<p>
0627 Lunch break, exited from FS19 for enjoyable meal...<br>
0649 Okay fed myself a days first meal, time to continue farming.
</p>

<p>
0722 Started harvesting corn F36, courseplay ETA 1h 24min, 4x tools<br>
0956 Finished harvesting corn F36
</p>

<p>
Then relocating coolamon mother bin and grain truck courseplay route to the side of the next field.
</p>

<p>
1018 Started harvesting corn F35, courseplay ETA 1h 23min, 4x tools<br>
1325 Finished harvesting corn F35
</p>

<p>
Got really exhausted playing, already knew before this field was completed that will stop playing for today when its done.
</p>

<p>
1327 Shut down FS19 for today, way too exhausted, more farming tomorrow...
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-29T1056</b> FS19 started up, lets continue harvesting.
</p>

<p>
Moved coolamon mother bin into position east of F34. Recorded new grain truck courseplay course. Unloaded all combines from corn, sent grain truck with the last remaining corn to dump into farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
Corn harvest was 2.179m liters, quite nice haul, will take a while to sell that as well unless I'll get that train track sell point added heh.
</p>

<p>
Refueled all the vehicles again, got to love large scale farming logistics :)
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 1956hrs night is quickly falling, I'm not going to harvest in a night so its time acceleration to skip the night.
</p>

<p>
1154 Started harvesting sunflowers F34, courseplay ETA 1h 24min, 4x tools<br>
1342 Finished harvesting sunflowers F34
</p>

<p>
That's it all the harvest have been completed for this season (unless double cropping that is).
</p>

<p>
Sunflowers harvest got me 647.4k liters of grain.
</p>

<p>
Felt great accomplishment by preparing and harvesting all these existing fields when looking at the huge amount of grain in our farm bin silo plus in the railroad silo 3. But at the same time while I was not bored or exhausted... I did feel a bit overwhelmed to start all of this over again because I'm either going to time accelerate for better market prices and sell grain or start the field work loop all over again.
</p>

<p>
It was funny that I was just sitting there looking at the mapview wondering what should I do next heh, obviously I need to do something because just watching gets me nowhere (fast heh) :)
</p>

<p>
Its not that I don't want to farm, I do, but the amount of work in real life 16hrs DAYS is a lot if I would now start to prepare the fields for the next planting season.
</p>

<p>
I would like to sell the grain to get millions of money so I could buy more land and possibly even upgrade some vehicles for example plowing two times 55ha with only one 15m plow doesn't sound very appealing to me, also only one seed hawk setup is not enough for these existing fields. But for selling the grain I need to buy at least another truck and more likely edit PMC Grange Gardens 16km terrain itself to include train track sell point so I can capture that amazing feeling of truly large scale farming logistics grain sell events like in FS17 Cornbelt using the train.
</p>

<p>
1438 Decided to take a little break, not from PMC Gaming but just to check out some other FS19 terrain stuff while I let the idea what to do next marinate a bit.
</p>

<p>
Was looking into adding train selling points but because of seasons savegame... its not going to be easy without creating a new savegame and I really don't want to do that right now. So I decided to just keep continue playing like this, time accelerating not doing any double cropping. Lets see how the crop sell prices change and which selling point they lead to. If its something silly like other side of the terrain... then dunno maybe I could do that train edit hehe
</p>

<p>
1655 Back in PMC Grande Gardens 16km, time acceleration continues...
</p>

<p>
23/late-autumn in-game 0801hrs canola market price is 2287 on selling point 10, its time to sell some grain :)
</p>

<p>
First I need to upgrade my equipment, going to buy another semi-tipper 70k liter trailer, this time with dolly and <i>another</i> trailer which gives me 140k combined carrying capacity in single load. Thats pretty nice for a semi truck.
</p>

<pre>
- 2x trailer semi-tipper 70000/6 69k
- trailer semi-tipper 70000/6 with oversize load option 69.1k
- 2x dolly 10l 9k
</pre>
<p>
1820 Purchased above list, budget now 415k
</p>

<p>
Budget sidenote, I get charged vehicle running costs about 1k - 1.5k every night, I don't know why. It started when I purchased the claas lexion 8900s and I suspect there was some bug with the leased telehandler and combine, I returned those, my leased menu is empty yet I get charge for fees.
</p>

<p>

1859 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.1k + 160.1k
</p>

<p>
Went and picked up the other semi-tipper 70k trailer with dolly from the shop using my other semi truck. Next I'm going to transfer all the canola from railroad silo 3 to farm bin silo. Yes tedious, I will get around to add the train connections and selling points one day heh.
</p>

<p>
1918 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.1k + 160.1k
</p>

<p>
When I had two semi trucks using 140k trailer capacity hauling grain from railroad silo 3 to farm bin silo... I felt like come on man, ANYTHING would be faster than this, I should have just gone and edited the terrain to add train depot connectivity with selling points, but no... I wanted to continue this same save to maintain the seasons save stuff hehe.
</p>

<p>
Oh well I'm definitely doing those edits ASAP and the next game-play harvest wise will be on the new terrain edits with proper train connectivity.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Canola market prices were increasing in selling point 6 so once they hit 2321 and stabilized there, I switched courseplay course to that location. Had to record a new course. Because of the train system being incomplete I drove my trucks unrealistically straight line across AI owned fields etc.
</p>

<p>
I was even considering cheating by looking at the market prices and how many liters I have grain, then edit savegame and just replace the grain with equal amount of money completely skipping the trucking... but that was just a quick thought nothing serious, if you are lazy enough not to edit the terrain for train selling points then shut the hell up and drive the trucks! :)
</p>

<p>
But yeah it all comes down to the crazy time sink that farmsim is, I really do not need my own terrain editing decisions (laziness) to cause any extra time wasted with this game heh. Anyways.

</p>

<p>
Well this massive upgrade to our farm land lots and equipment should last us for couple of harvests maybe. I think our plowing and cultivating strenght is a bit weak so we'll see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking of doing one harvest with PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 and once I have mega amounts of crops in farm bin silo and possibly in some railroad silos, I can then do the terrain edits and upgrade terrain <i>plus</i> seasons savegame which definitely is not going to be easy.

<p>
1126 Started fertilizing F39, courseplay ETA 40min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
In some odd way after all that time spent harvesting... it felt refreshing, really good to be back in "regular" field work like fertilizing, heh sounds strange I know. I bet this mood quickly passes when we get into those 2hrs+ courseplay ETA's haha
</p>

<p>
For crop rotation I made a field info list of all my fields now, but still trying to learn to memorize all that legume, oilseed, nightshade and fallow stuff so I can just take a glance at the mapview and right away know what to seed/plant next or if I need to leave the field fallow.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if seasons crop rotation is just the extra layer of fertilization, or do I get yield penalty even with 100% fertilized, limed, plowed and 0% weeds when I spam the same crop type over and over again. Seasons manual does not state anything regarding this, I think it assumes users "get it" fully from the crop rotation planner menu tool. Edit: yes crop rotation gives you penalty even with everything 100% ok if you just keep spamming like soybeans every year.
</p>

<p>
1215 Finished fertilizing F39<br>
1217 The game froze when started refilling rubicon 9000 from utts-32000 tanker, as usual<br>
1223 Once again finished fertilizing F39 ;)<br>

Surprising how relatively little time it takes to plow this field, I was expecting my first 2hrs+ ETA. Well not to worry, those are coming soon hehe.
</p>

<p>
Then performance went to crap, had 7 vehicles running under courseplay courses (so hired AI) and 20 FPS, oh man it was awful to play a game with such performance :(
</p>

<p>
Don't want to sound overly dramatic but everytime this 20 FPS crap performance happens I get the immediate feeling of just shutting down and uninstalling FS19 because why would you play a game with well, unplayable performance. 20 FPS is like vic-20 in the early 80's :(

Seems like lime spreading and plowing tasks ended within minutes of each other and now I have a long wait because I need fertilizing but the rubicons are tied up on F04 like close to four hours heh. I could of course go load bredals with solid fertilizer and continue, hmm we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Took Big Bud 450 and went to fix small plow line on south edge of F33. It makes no difference in yields but pisses me off as there is nasty red line for no reason, this will fix it. Also fixed couple of missed spots and corners on F34-F36 and eastern edge line on F34.

At this point the rubicons on F04 still had 2hrs to go and I decided to go watch some TV in the mean time. Yes I know I know, courseplay playing the game for your while you leave the computer is... no way of farming, but I literally have nothing to do here except watch rubicons drive back and forth especially when there is the constant fear of game freezes if I would start go goof around something. So TV it is at least for this time.

<b>2019-11-01T1454</b> Aand back at PMC Gaming as I have nothing better to do, firing up FS19 and off to farm.
</p>

<p>
Was really fed up playing yesterday. Today did my monthly chores and then just realized that nothing interests me editing wise, so as I had nothing else to do... I falled back to what I know, farming heh.
</p>

<p>
First I'm gonna take Fendt 1050 with john deere 2623 plow and go fix the edges on several fields which has annoying red plow line.
</p>

<p>
1512 Plow fixed edge in F04 east side<br>

1535 Plow fixed edge in F28 east side<br>
1540 Started cultivating F04, courseplay ETA 13h 18min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Haha hilarious 13hrs field work :D
</p>

<p>
F04 is about 880 hectares so its a big boy. Was considering splitting it to two maybe even four sections, but decided to go as is. Courseplay generated 43,691 waypoint course heh.
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km has about 5 fields of this size and then the monstrous biggest field in history. Interesting to see that courseplay did work on such field size, I have even seen over 50k waypoint courses but cant remember if this was back in FS17 hmm anyways.
</p>

<p>
This field work will not be finished today because I fall a sleep before this is done. Not only that but I get bored to DEATH if I'd sit here for 13hrs while big bud 450's are pulling john deere 2410 5 section cultivators around. But we will keep going and dunno most likely I watch some tv etc while this is running. Lets see how far we get today.
</p>

<p>
Oh and imagine once this field is seeded with canola, the amount of liters we get out of this will be insane :)

</p>

<p>
1229 Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 booted up, lets wrap up this field work prep for next season.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay with the 43k waypoint F04 course (and F29 plow course as well) really bogged down FS19 startup, it took over 10 minutes to parse through the existing saved courses before savegame was loaded. As always you should not save huge courses, but I rather save it and continue just by loading it than generating a brand new course after each startup and then try to align the vehicles to it.
</p>

<p>
1245 All three courseplay courses up and running, we continue...<br>
1253 Update; plow courseplay ETA 56min, cultivator ETA 13min. We are slowly getting there<br>
1314 Courseplay portion of F04 cultivating was done, now just have to GPS manually fix the SE corner (field definition issue)<br>
1357 Finished cultivating F04<br>
1405 Finished ploughing F29
</p>

<p>
Uuaah finally those life sucking practically day long field work tasks were done. Now still got two fields to cultivate and fertilize, then we are done for this season.

</p>

<p>
Here is the list for field states as of now, as you can see we have few fields which need to be fallow on next year and rest are ready for seeding/planting:
</p>

<p>
F04 seed canola<br>
F23 seed corn<br>
F24 seed soybeans<br>
F25 seed soybeans<br>
F26 all done, barley growing ;)<br>
F27 seed corn, fert<br>
F28 fallow?<br>
F29 seed soybeans<br>
F33 seed corn, fert<br>
F34 seed corn<br>
F35 fallow<br>
F36 fallow<br>
F37 seed corn, fert<br>
F38 seed canola, fert<br>
F39 fallow
</p>

<p>
There was few lucrative fertilizing contracts but I had so much work to do already that I really do not need any more haha. So next we are going to time accelerate until we pass the winter and arrive to spring when we are able to start seeding canola and then later corn and soybeans.
</p>

<p>
08/early-winter in-game 1535hrs corn market price hit record high (for me) 1556 and guess what... it was on selling point 8 which is basically IN my farm :)
</p>

<p>
So obviously I'll load up rubicons to low boy tailers and drive my trucks to the farm HQ and get ready for to sell my corn from the farm bin silo. Aayeah gimme that money!
</p>

<p>
1842 Sold corn in selling point 8 for 109k + 109k
</p>

<p>
Right after that first selling my hardware glitched so that mouse started to make windows beep noise every time I pressed LMB, so that mean I needed to reboot my machine.
</p>

<p>
1935 Computer restarted, FS19 back up, lets continue. Corn market price on selling point 8 is now 1561 and increasing.
</p>

<p>
1937 Sold corn in selling point 8 for 109.3k + 109.3k<br>
1944 Time accelerated one hour and price stabilized at 1566, ok lets sell<br>

<p>

2024 Sold corn in selling point 8 for 109.8k + 109.8k, this was the last full truck load<br>
2026 Sold corn in selling point 8 for 109.8k + 15.3k, thats it, all corn sold
</p>

<p>
Budget now 3.558m which is pretty nice amount, didn't even expect anything cool from the corn sales and almost forgot them for this season. I don't have any plans on purchasing anything, but definitely need to improve that cultivator and plough equipment as it takes forever to do those tasks now.
</p>

<p>
FS19 is such an crappy engine that once you have more than 5-6 vehicles running under courseplay (so hired AI) the performance goes to the dogs, when I was doing this seasons cultivating it was pretty constant 20 FPS performance which is atrociously bad. So if I buy more equipment it just means more lag, but yeah if two big bud 450's pulling john deere 2410's already cause at least 30 FPS maybe even less performance... when it sucks what difference it makes how much it sucks.
</p>

<p>
08/early-winter in-game 1940hrs started to time accelerate in small increments, corn market price topped at 1581.
</p>

<p>
09/mid-winter in-game 0153hrs it started to snow, at in-game 0835hrs there was snow in the ground even though the snowfall had ended hours before :)
</p>

<p>
Snow stayed in the ground for couple of in-game days.
</p>

<p>
22/late-winter sunflowers market price peaked at 2522 in selling point 7 (not that I care but I have 647k liters what needs to be sold).
</p>

<p>
It was 24/late-winter, I saved the game, backupped the saves, <b>upgraded to Seasons v1.0.1.8-beta build 35</b> from 2019-10-31 and started the game back up again. We are ready for another year :)
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring sunflowers market price peaked 2551 in selling point 10. The price was good so decided to go sell the 647k liters I got.
</p>

<p>

2322 Sold sunflowers in selling point 10 for 178.4k + 44.3k
</p>

<p>
All the sunflowers are sold, budget now 5.169m
</p>

<p>
Was looking at the nearby fields and only thing right next to my farm are the monster sized fields to which I don't have enough money now and well F40 I would be save for last anyways as its the crown jewel of this terrain hehe.
</p>

<p>
So I'm going to purchase some vehicles, not sure what yet. My harvesters are good they are actually the best, the mentioned cultivating / ploughing equipment does need an upgrade for example the john deere 2410 to flexicoil st820 and just more plows and tractors.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing... well two rubicon 9000's work pretty nice but I could of course get some more, but if my fields now take about 15-40min average to spray that is pretty ok. Having more sprayers is just more work to low boy them around I think. Sure at some point I do increase the sprayer number to four definitely but don't feel like doing it now.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing tankers I could use more or rather dedicated fertilizing and herbicide UTTS-32000 tanker trailer so I don't have to swap that liquid back and forth every time.
</p>

<p>
Hmm what else... two seed hawks is fine and four great plains corn planters... dunno how many planters do we need for the big fields, still needs to be tested.
</p>

<p>
Actually to think of it more the vehicles and equipment are pretty decent already, just minor tweaks there to improve our fleet.
</p>

<p>
09/mid-spring in-game 0737hrs weather is now +6/+6C so I could seed canola but I'm in no hurry because four days from now weather forecast predicts minimum temperature of +3C which is deadly for new seeds. Not that the soil would cool down so much overnight but still, why risk it. With 24 day season there is so much days to time accelerate so lets not start too soon.
</p>

<p>
And hardware glitch again (its a long story and I wont be telling it here), had to cold reset the whole computer, luckily didn't lose any progress because I was just time accelerating waiting for seeding season weather.
</p>

<p>
11/mid-spring weather forecast predicts lowest temperature from now on is +8C (day after tomorrow), so guess I'll start seeding canola then. Planting season has started aayeah! :)
</p>

<p>
I am really excited about this planting season, so much work went into getting the fields ready so it feels very good now to start putting seed into the ground. It feels like I spent real life <i>days</i> to prepare these fields.
</p>

<p>
This is not yet the largest farmsim operation I have played, the seasons test on this same terrain was a bit bigger, but that was just test so it don't really count. I'm enthusiastic to grow my farm in this savegame which is legit, no cheating, no crap (ie placeable money making cheat mods like that other savegame I mentioned), cant wait until this savegame gets so big as the other one and yeah bigger of course as the goal is to purchase all the fields in this megalodon terrain :)
</p>

<p>

Oh man it felt so good to be running big bud 747 with seed hawk putting some seed to the ground, it feels like forever since I was seeding the last time, it definitely is real life days ago heh.
</p>

<p>
Headland wasnt even done yet when I was already thinking that hmm, maybe the seeding fleet does need an upgrade, four seed hawks doesn't sound that bad ;)
</p>

</p>

<p>
Ah first field in this second year seeded, great. Next on the list is that F04 my biggest field in this savegame which is monstrous 880 hectares... yeah I think we need to buy couple more seed hawk setups hehe.
</p>

<p>
But first I topped off these two guys with seeds.
</p>

<p>
0323 Purchased 2x big bud 747 and 2x seed hawk :)
</p>

<p>
Had to record courseplay course around F04 to get that nice outline for it, otherwise the generated course looks bad because terrains field definition is bugged somehow.
</p>

<p>
0351 Started seeding canola F04, courseplay ETA 5h 10min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
Well five hours and ten minutes of seeding with FOUR seed hawks hehe. This is large scale farming, you knew we do things big so stop being shocked by these field work times hehe. But man imagine if I had started this with only two tools, over ten hours duration and surely they would have ran out of seeds couple of times :)
</p>

<p>
When we get to harvest this 880ha field, that will be fun day of game-play that's for sure heh ;)
</p>

<p>
0532 Third hardware glitch of today, that is a new record for me and sucks big time. I was already pretty tired on borrowed time so with this cold reset required to the computer I decided to call it a night. More farming tomorrow, refilling seed hawks is coming up.
</p>

<p>
1335 Back at PMC Gaming FS19 booted up, lets get those Big Bud 747's with Seed Hawk's rolling again, we got canola to seed! :)
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Four seed hawks seeding 880ha field require FOUR refills, that is pretty crazy. Also worth to mention that the fourth refill became just before last row, in the last row I needed only two big buds because how the courseplay course was generated, but yes 880ha == 4x seed hawk refill.
</p>

<p>
1749 Finished seeding canola F04<br>
1801 Started seeding soybeans F25, courseplay ETA 30min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
This F25 is 73.146 ha in size and its almost too small for four seed hawks. Well, almost... 30mins is nice time to seed and imagine multiplying that by four if we would be using only one tool. But yes with small fields you quickly can run into traffic jams and confusion on your own part that "which tool was going where again???" and that is no fun. Huge fields are much more simpler.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-04T0103</b> Back in PMC Gaming and we continue farming
</p>

<p>
Corn planting weather has not arrived, we need to time accelerate but in the mean time I'll refill seed hawks and park them somewhere.
</p>

<p>
0111 Ran out of seeds in elmers haulmaster, need to go pickup some more<br>
0126 Seed hawks refilled with seeds<br>
0144 Big Bud 747's diesel refilled (well ok except lead vehicle its about 90% full)<br>
</p>

<p>
Now we time accelerate until weather and soil is ready for corn planting.
</p>

<p>
The soybean planting I just did... was a complete mistake, in my seed hawk excitement after the canola seeding I just went and proceeded with soybeans... paying no attention that while canola is seeded with +6C soil temperature <i>soybeans require +10C</i>. Uh oh!
</p>

<p>
This is such a major mistake that I immediately thought about restoring a backupped savegame, but I haven't taken any and dunno how FS19 itself handles those. Yes restoring a backupped savegame is kind of cheat, well in some ways.
</p>

<p>
With seasons and planting failing due soil temperature... not sure what I can or need to do next, do I need to cultivate the fields over the badly failed soybean seeds or can I just use seed hawk and seed again? No idea.
</p>

<p>
I went through the FS19 backupped (not me) savegames, there was only recent ones and one where I had just started seeding canola on F04. This means there is no way for me to restore the savegame between F04 seeding completed and the huge mistake soybean +6C seeding started.
</p>

<p>
What is done is done, I'll face the music with the soybean seeding. I bet it requires cultivation before re-seeding at best, or worst... the whole field is "lost" for this season.
</p>

<p>
The soybean fields show growth: planted, before previous and previous: fallow. Interesting. So if its fallow then I can continue my normal crop rotation planting on them (which would be soybeans by coincidence). The question remains, how and when, do I need to cultivate these seeds under or what...
</p>

<p>
This is heart breaking to see my soybean seeds going to waste, I mean those fields werent actually huge but they still took a while to seed and definitely took a bunch of seeds which are precious commodity in the farm, they are not to be wasted.
</p>

<p>
Well now I have this experience with seasons, never thought I'd make such lame mistake of seeding when soil temperature is not suitable heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
16/mid-spring in-game 0658hrs, +11/+9C, weather forecast shows no minimum temperatures below +10C anymore so its just matter of time (acceleration) until we are in corn/soybean planting season. F24, F25 and F29 show planted and fallow.
</p>

<p>
17/late-spring in-game 0658hrs (yes exactly same as yesterday hehe) overnight soil temperature hit +10C. F24, F25 and F29 show planted and fallow.
</p>

<p>
I tried to seed F24 with a seed hawk, but nothing happened the seeder acted like usual when trying to seed over already seeded field; no seeds get expended. So yeah I need to cultivate the fields first, sigh. Oh well, better get to it then...
</p>

<pre>
- tractor big bud 450 with gps and twin wheels 252k
- cultivator 500hp 24m flexicoil st820 186k
</pre>
<p>
0322 Purchased the above tractors twice and cultivators four times, budget now 2.006m.
</p>

<p>
Cultivated F24, F25 and F29, heck if I know when..<br>
0631 I'm <i>so</i> done...
</p>

<p>
1755 Back at PMC Gaming with FS19 started up, yesterday was a big failure but the show must go on.
</p>

<p>
Small explanation for yesterday is in place... I was really disappointed by my soybean seeding mistake, then some real life stuff annoyed me on top of that, plus all the usual farmsim 20FPS performance burnout boredom etc that I almost rage quit. I did the cultivating but I was literally red in the face angry pretty much ready to start slamming furniture around, luckily I never do such things and its extremely rare for me to get angry in the first place. When the cultivating was done I just saved the game and exited as it also was late at night for me already. I didn't write down play-by-play because just didn't feel like it. Honestly I still don't so below the re-seeding of soybean fields will be just cold three oneliners heh.
</p>

<p>
I am clearly in a very dark place, I have completely lost the will and enthusiasm to play FS19 now, what begun as complete obsession to play Start From Zero, to grow our farm (in both Midwest Horizon and here), its gone now, bye bye, adios! I am now simply playing because I don't have anything else to do, as sad as that sounds.
</p>

<p>
I'm not complaining don't get me wrong, I just want to be totally honest in these Start From Zero stories because as much as its about playing farmsim its also a lot to do how I feel while I play farmsim.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Well, done seeding now, finally.
</p>

<p>
Corn planting season has begun, now we are using four great plains YP-2425A planters pulled by Case IH Optum 300 CVX tractors.
</p>

<p>
Tried to start planting corn to F37 but nothing happened... then I realized that doh, great plains YP-2425A planter is not capable of cultivating itself and our field of course is NOT cultivated, its on plain harvested state heh.
</p>

<p>
The joys of corn planting or using non seed hawk equipment hehe.
</p>

<p>
Oh well lets go pickup Big Bud 450's with Flexicoil ST820 cultivators and get this field cultivated hehe. Luckily our other corn planting fields seem to be cultivated so not much field work to do.
</p>

<p>
2029 Started cultivating F37, courseplay ETA 32min, 4x tools<br>
2113 Finished cultivating F37<br>
2114 Started seeding corn F37, courseplay ETA 37min, 4x tools<br>
2158 Finished seeding corn F37
</p>

<p>
When this planting finished I was almost out of seeds in the corn planters, lead vehicle had only 81 liters left and last one had 688 liters (as trailing vehicles travel less distance). This F37 size is 55.88ha so that is pretty rough estimate the 4x great plains corn planters get emptied on 55ha field.
</p>

<p>
I'm still not sure which tool is the best, the john deere db90 and db120 are extremely wide planters but their seed tank size is laughable. So no idea if lets say four db 120's could get this field seeded without refilling, I don't think so as the seed usage is standard and db 120 would just have 1400 liters less seeds per planter.
</p>

<p>
2211 Started seeding corn F33, courseplay ETA 2h 19min, 4x tools<br>
2317 Herbicide sprayed F38 by cherry picking current weed patches<br>
2322 Started fertilizing F37, courseplay ETA 34min, 1x tools<br>
2357 Finished fertilizing F37
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-05T0059</b> Finished seeding corn F33
</p>

<p>
Planting corn to 220ha field wasnt too bad with this 4x great plains YP-2425A equipment setup. I was expecting something very painful but this was pretty ok. In some way it was nice refreshing change for all that seed hawk canola/soybeans seeding, I mean sure of course I have planted a lot of corn in my time but still planting corn is far more foreign to me than seed hawk use.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm already sweating about how many millions of liters corn do I get to harvest from 220ha field hehe.
</p>

<p>
0103 Started seeding corn F34, courseplay ETA 37min, 4x tools<br>

0351 Finished seeding corn F27
</p>

<p>
All the seeding/planting has been done, all that remains is fertilizing F27 and F33, then just keeping an eye on weeds.
</p>

<p>
0353 Going to take a break by looking at the time most likely call it a night. This went pretty well today, satisfied feeling after getting all the seeding done.
</p>

<p>
1432 New farming day has started, FS19 booted up, lets wrap up the planting season.
</p>

<p>
1444 Herbicide spray cherry picking weed patches F04<br>
</p>

<p>
My general thought is that its better to just blanket spray the whole field (using courseplay) and be done with it, no need to worry and check the fields every so often for weeds, stressing out what is too much weeds and what is not. But I really don't have enough experience to make that judgement yet, sure I have been playing with seasons since 2019-07-24 day after its release but still haven't put my finger on the weed randomness.
</p>

<p>
Manual states that first year is easier, cant really say I like that approach because it really gives false impression on every savegame you start, especially if you do those terrain upgrades and have to revert back to year 1 constantly. Read somewhere else that weeds get more aggressive on every harvest.
</p>

<p>
1511 Started fertilizing F33, courseplay ETA 1h 2min, 2x tools<br>

1853 Herbicide spray cherry picked weed patches F24
</p>

<p>
18/late-spring in-game 1028hrs, all fields seeded/planted, fertilized (mostly last year already) and weeds sprayed so far. All fields germinated and growing.
</p>

<p>
Now its just time accelerating waiting for possible weeds to grow and then finally crops are ready to harvest. Can't wait for harvest season :)
</p>

<p>
21/late-spring in-game 0723hrs, weeds are very slowly growing back to my fields. No weeds yet for F23, F25, F27 and F34, dunno why.
</p>

<p>
24/late-spring in-game 0634hrs, weeds have grown quite a bit now, almost feels like it would have been simpler just blanket spray everything after harvest to be done with this guessing game. Right now I need to go cherry pick spraying total of 5 fields. Then I'm not sure if the weeds still grow but today is the last day before earliest canola harvest days, so gotta get it done now.
</p>

<p>
1933 Started herbicide spray cherry picking weed patches F24<br>

2026 Started herbicide spray cherry picking weed patches F38<br>
2029 Finished spraying F38
</p>

<p>
Depending on the field it really doesn't take long to spray cherry picking the weed patches. This method also consumes bare minimum amount of herbicide. But you run the risk of whack-a-mole, you spray the field then fast forward and then more weed patches pop up and you start again, that gets old real fast.
</p>

<p>
What is really frustrating is the driving around especially on these large terrains. You load sprayer to a low boy, drive to the field, unload the sprayer and spray the field, if you have to repeat this many times due cherry picking it REALLY gets old fast.
</p>

<p>
With cherry picking it is already too much to return into same field the second time. When you do that you realize it would have been simpler just blanket spray the whole field after harvest and be done with it...
</p>

<p>
Its also worth to consider that if you have a huge field like F04 which is 880ha and it gets about 10 or even less patches... is it worth to go spray them?
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 0653hrs, so finished spraying then time accelerated to this moment and new weeds have popped up in F04 and F24. That is it, I'm going to purchase dedicated herbicide sprayer vehicle setup and pre-emptively blanket spray every field after the harvest. This kind of whack-a-mole mickey mouse game is waste of my time. Lesson learned.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to wait few more days until the crops grow or it seems no more weeds pop up, then go YET AGAIN spray these fields, for one last time. Just have to be careful that the fields wont switch to harvest ready stage before I get to them. Although no big loss, there are very few weed patches currently, would not be a big yield loss for them.
</p>

<p>
Hmm actually I'm going to time accelerate until the growth stages get to dark green which is the last one before they switch to harvest ready, that is a good sign to go spray a field.
</p>

<p>
Oh and the soybean selling date is coming up soon, still days away but have to be careful not to miss it as I have 837k liters to sell.
</p>

<p>
2043 After time accelerating F04 is dark green with weed patches<br>
2049 Decided to take a lunch break, just wanted to take hands off keyboard for a while<br>
2203 Back at FS19, lets spray some fields<br>
2209 Started herbicide spray cherry picking weed patches F04<br>
2214 Finished spraying F04
</p>

<p>
F04 was growing canola which was flowering state, it was impossible to see the new weeds which were in the small green plant stage. I had to look mapview to guide my sprayer on the weeds.
</p>

<p>
This is another reason which makes pre-emptive blanket spraying the best option.
</p>

<p>
Alright so F26 is harvest ready barley, this was the field that I bought already seeded. Lets get to it. First I need to drive a truck grain haul line somewhere, then get combines and go pickup regular headers.
</p>

<p>
Dumped seeds from elmers haulmaster into railroad silo 4, no idea if these silos are meant to store seeds at least I cant see them on the ESC selling points menu heh, hopefully I can load the seeds back from train.
</p>

<p>
Then drive the combines with corn headers into the railroad silo where the normal headers were stored. Hmm I really need to buy header trailers for the midwest durus monster headers, its waste of time driving these combines around for no reason other than to go pickup headers from where ever.
</p>

<pre>
- trailer for header midwest durus 18m 22.5k
</pre>
<p>
2300 Purchased above times four, budget now 1.892m
</p>

<p>
Recorded courseplay course from F37 NE to F26 NE and send lexion combines on their way. Man it takes forever to move these slow girls.
</p>

<p>
Back in FS17 I split my vehicles to four sectors, NW, NE, SW and SE. It was easy to switch into different regions vehicles using deckers vehicle group switcher, this way I didn't have to drive slow big buds across the terrain every time when I change fields, each vehicle group had their assigned sector where they always stayed. Not the most efficient way to use vehicles, like having EIGHT big buds instead of just two, but yeah it is just crazy to drive any vehicle let alone slow big ones across the terrain.
</p>

<p>
And in FS17 I mostly played in North West Texas and Parker's Prairie, in my Cornbelt savegame I didn't manage to get that far to split my vehicles into four sectors before FS19 was released. So far I have not had large enough operations (relatively) in FS19 to split my vehicles up. Time will come, soon ;)
</p>

<p>
In FS19 we have vehicle explorer mod which feels much more comfortable to use than FS17's vehicle group switcher. I'm very happy checking out info and switching to my other vehicles in vehicle explorer now. Yes it does not have labels for vehicle groups its actually one huge long list, which kind of sounds bad but in practice its very easy to use and I at least so far can easily see which vehicle is in which region of the terrain etc. I really love how you can see the statistics of the vehicle like wear, dirt, fuel and fill levels if available.
</p>

<p>
2339 Started harvesting barley F36, courseplay ETA 2h 10min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-06T0113</b> It started to rain in-game 01/early-summer 1851hrs even though weather forecast predicted it to 2100hrs
</p>

<p>
Then night fell and had to time accelerate until the morning daylight, in-game 02/early-summer 0610hrs crops are wet... more time accelerating and in-game 1831hrs crops are dry, lets continue harvesting.
</p>

<p>
0213 Another lunch break, the barley harvest was really tedious heh, I don't like barley<br>
0315 Lunch break over, lets continue this damn barley harvest<br>
0418 In-game 2020hrs it started to rain, forecasted raining for next 24hrs ! whoah!
</p>

<p>
So time accelerating until the weather improves and crops dry up...
</p>

<p>
More weeds to F04 hehe, oh well like said I am going to blanket spray the fields from now on. Weather forecast shows clear skies for tonight 2100hrs, lets see if by tomorrow morning the crops were dry to harvest.
</p>

<p>
0428 In-game 04/early-summer 1440hrs crops are dry, lets harvest<br>
0614 Finished harvesting barley F36
</p>

<p>
F26 is 135.571 ha in size, it did not look that big on the map, heh. Harvesting this field took a really long time, courseplay ETA was 2h 10min and that was ridiculously LOW number in comparison as in real time it took more than TWICE that long. This was mainly because barley yielded so crazy amounts that combines got full twice in one pass and had to <i>constantly</i> stop because single grain cart could not keep up.
</p>

<p>
For next time when you purchase a field which is lets say larger than 50ha and barley... just plow it under man, its not worth wasting your time harvesting that crazy yielding worthless barley. Save your time to canola/corn/soybeans.
</p>

<p>
F26 barley (not even fully fertilized) yielded 2.362 million liters haha.
</p>

<p>
0627 It was getting late and started to be a bit exhausted so decided to call it a night here, this harvest was nice accomplishment for today.
</p>

<p>
1820 New farming day has started, FS19 is up, time to prepare for the big harvests.
</p>

<p>
1826 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F29, it only had three patches of weeds<br>
1831 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F24<br>
1839 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F04, yes... one more time, wonder if this will be the last?<br>
1845 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F33<br>
1846 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F38<br>
1850 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F37
</p>

<p>
And again all weeds have been sprayed from the fields that are growing crops currently (other fallow fields do have weeds but they do not concern me).
</p>

<p>
In this round of spraying I did not see one single patch of flowery weeds, they were all young green plants which could not be spotted from the growing canola/corn/soybean greenery. Again why pre-emptive blanket weed spraying is the way to go.
</p>

<p>
05/early-summer in-game 0642hrs, more weeds popped up on F04, F24 and F29... yeah I give up, let them grow I'm done with this whack-a-mole mickey mouse game of chasing weeds, next year its all blanket spraying with dedicated herbicide sprayer equipment.
</p>

<p>
In-game 1142hrs barley is on high demand in selling point 10. I'm going to take the NW train, load it up with barley and transfer it as close to selling point as currently possible, then using trucks go sell several loads of it (but I leave some for seed factory). This is my first time using trains in PMC terrain :)
</p>

<p>
Looks like with PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 I can use the NW train tracks to pickup grain from railroad silo 4, dump it on railroad silo 1 which is the main hub (kinda, for now), then use NE train to pick it up from railroad silo 1 and dump to railroad silo 5 which is literally on top of selling point 10 :)
</p>

<p>
1906 Started loading the NW train in railroad silo 4<br>
1907 First car loaded with 143k liters of barley, whee my first train use in PMC terrain! :)
</p>

<p>
THIS is what I've been waiting for in FS19, huge terrain and massive logistic operations just like in FS17 Cornbelt using trains, except just... <b>BIGGER</b> :-)
</p>

<p>
I mean this really felt like magical loading my first ever PMC terrain massive grain train car setup in order the haul it logistics style to the other side of the terrain. It just... this is just so damn cool man! :)
</p>

<p>
1937 All 2.362m liters of barley loaded from railroad silo 4<br>
1949 Unfortunately v0.1.3 was bugged and I could not overload / dump into railroad silo 3 from the train<br>
2001 Uh oh same goes for railroad silo 1 and 4 as well
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 is bugged, NW train cannot unload/dump at any of the connected railroad silos, damnit. I need to fix that but... for this seasons savegame in middle of the season with all my hard work seeding and caring those fields... I need to do some XML editing magic and transfer the grain into my farm bin silo which would otherwise be cheating but the terrain is bugged I tried to play normally but I cannot, its not my fault (as a player) so yes I'm going to savegame XML edit fix this.
</p>

<p>
First I removed all the 2.362m liters of barley from the train vehicles.xml, then I added 1.0m liters directly to the farmer_schubi's seed factory. Then I put 181,055 liters into farm bin silo. And finally I put 1.181m liters to railroad silo 5 which is next to selling point 10.
</p>

<p>
2114 Back in-game after editing XML for barley train bug, in truck heading to railroad silo 5<br>

<p>
That was all the barley I wanted to sell, budget now 3.167m. Exited the game for some planning on the soybean selling.
</p>

<p>
Edited items.xml and magically moved the soybeans from railroad silo 4 to railroad silo 10. Then drove truck from F26 down to railroad silo 10.
</p>

All the soybeans have been sold with special high demand market price (4604 in the end), budget now 7.023m :)
</p>

<p>
2314 Its time for me to take a quick break...
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-07T0037</b> Back in FS19, how about some harvesting...
</p>

<p>
Just driving the trucks back from the railroad silos, both basically in the opposite ends of the terrain heh. But then I'm pretty much ready for some harvesting action so hopefully with time acceleration first field is ready soon (and not too much combine driving to that field).
</p>

<p>
07/early-summer in-game 0623hrs, few more weeds have popped up but I wont be bothered with those. Soybean market price 3705.
</p>

<p>
08/early-summer in-game 0618hrs, soybean market price 3841. Today with annual statistics is the seasons second best soybean selling day.
</p>

<p>
09/mid-summer in-game 0556hrs, soybean market price 3806. Today with annual statistics is the seasons best soybean selling day, which oddly at least in the morning now is less than yesterday. I guess the seasons market price fluctuations arent exact science in that sense. Not that less than 40 would be a big difference in grand scheme of things, but obviously you want to squeeze every last bit out of it, especially when you reach millions of liters volume.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-summer in-game 0050hrs yep that was the day, now soybeans market price is dropping again. And F04 and F38 are ready to harvest, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
0120 Exited from Start From Zero, started new career with pickup truck and going to record courseplay outline for 4 corners of F04 so its more manageable to harvest.<br>
0158 Done, courses saved and now I'm ready to harvest.
</p>

<p>
0217 Courseplay caused some sort of bug, had to kill FS19 task, decided to revert to the last stable courseplay version.
</p>

<p>
Ready to start harvesting canola on F04 but crops are too wet, so time acceleration while they dry up.
</p>

<p>
0245 Time accelerated to in-game 1709hrs and it just started to rain again hehe<br>
</p>

<p>
0247 Started harvesting canola F04 SE, courseplay ETA 3h 10min, 4x tools<br>
0624 Time to call it a night, have some chores to do before bedtime.
</p>

<p>
1853 Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 fired up, we continue harvesting F04 SE corner...
</p>

<p>
Canola harvest with 4x claas lexion 8900s with midwest durus 18m headers and one grain cart is so hectic that you don't have a moment of downtime. One grain cart is not enough for this setup, but I'll rather have few waiting combines than me waiting for combines while watching youtube farming videos. Lunch break was coming up so I decided to just relax and shutdown FS19 while I eat, its just impossible to play and eat at the same time I would be just stressing myself out. The field will still be there after the lunch break ;)
</p>

<p>
1951 Exited FS19 for a lunch break...<br>
2024 Lunch break is over, F04 SE harvest continues
</p>

<p>
2245 Finished harvesting canola F04 SE
</p>

<p>
It was a long harvest, courseplay duration wont mean much with 3h 10min estimated time because all the stops combines make when full are caused by my grain cart driving as one cart just cannot keep up with such volume of grain. The practical real life hours spent playing this harvest took probably TWICE as long, I'd say it was 6-7hrs (too lazy to do minute accurate calculation from the above hehe)
</p>

<p>
So lets say 7, hell round it up to 8hrs per one corner of this field, I'm still looking at least 24hrs of continuous harvesting game-play to finish the three corners. Heh that is some hard core harvesting for sure :)
</p>

<p>
F04 SE harvest of canola, which was in pretty good shape btw, got me 2.910m liters of grain. That's what I got now in railroad silo 4 and I'll continue to dump there until the capacity is full. If one corner gets 2.9m liters then the remaining three corners gets additional 8.7m liters and railroad silo 4 will run out of space (railroad silos are now 10m liter capacity) :)
</p>

<p>
Well we figure that out once we get there in three or so days from now haha ;)
</p>

<p>
Anyways. I drove new grain truck routes to F04 SW corner which goes again to railroad silo 4.
</p>

<p>
2322 Started harvesting canola F04 SW, courseplay ETA 3h 14min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-08T0113</b> Needed to take a lunch break again...<br>
0216 Lunch break over, lets get back to harvesting. Need to refuel all those vehicles again heh.
</p>

<p>
Sold farmer_schubi's diesel fueld production factory as its useless, well ok not useless but WAY too expensive. It simply makes no sense, the placeable itself costs sickening 225k, then from 70k liters of canola you get like 20k liters of diesel fuel. Vertex design fuel tank placeable costs 5000 and sells you diesel super cheap compared to what the 70k liters of canola would profit if you sold it.
</p>

<p>
Got like 110k or something from the diesel fuel factory when I sold it. Bought the vertex design fuel tank for 5000 or some moneys.
</p>

<p>
0313 Vehicles fueled and good to go, harvest continues<br>
0331 In-game 1610hrs weather forecast shows 60% chance of rain for midnight, uh, lets hope not...<br>
0708 Lunch break, exited from FS19<br>
0739 Okay lunch break is over, back to work
</p>

<p>
However immediately upon entering the game it started to rain, I have long suspected there is just slight difference between long running game session and whats written in the savegame XML files and saving & restarting the game might sometimes cause issues like this.
</p>

<p>
11/mid-summer in-game 1944hrs and the predicted rain was for midnight, but now all of the sudden seasons weather menu shows 1800hrs with 90% chance of rain and same for 2100hrs, mignight now is just overcast weather. Oh well, we start to time accelerate...
</p>

<p>
12/mid-summer in-game 0608hrs it rained bit during the night, soil and crops are now wet. Just a tad of time acceleration and 0715hrs soil and crop is dry, combines rolling out.
</p>

<p>
0818 Railroad silo 4 has now 5.220m liters of canola! ;)<br>
0947 Finished harvesting canola F04 SW
</p>

<p>
Alright second corner of this 880ha F04 harvested, still another half of field size to go hehe. With todays harvest railroad silo 4 has now 5.960m liters of canola. If we do wild guesstimate calculation of how much money that makes with the best market price, its something around 13.8m and I still have half of the field to harvest, hehe crazy! that is just so crazy stuff! :)
</p>

<p>
I wasnt tired or exhausted just so bored for the continuous harvest grain cart driving back and forth without moments of peace. Also the two more days of same harvesting grind is kind of depressing hehe. Decided to call it a night here, there is plenty of more harvesting for tomorrow no need to start next F04 corner tonight, better to end it here with good feeling of accomplishment when SW corner just got finished.
</p>

<p>
1002 Shut down FS19, more farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
1904 New farming day has started, so same old F04 harvesting hehe
</p>

<p>
First order of business today is to drive a new grain truck courseplay courses for F04 NW south side and refuel all the vehicles. You gotta love large scale farming, day starts by refueling heh.
</p>

<p>
Took a while to get those refuel and truck routes sorted out this time heh.
</p>

<p>
1953 Started harvesting canola F04 NW, courseplay ETA 3h 26min, 4x tools<br>
2118 Exited from FS19 for lunch break...<br>
2142 OK lunch break over, we continue the harvest<br>
2235 Need to take a quick half an hour or so break here<br>
2312 Break is over, lets get back to farming
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-09T0330</b> Finished harvesting canola F04 NW<br>
</p>

<p>
F04 NW harvest felt like it went a little bit easier boredom wise than previous, but yes sure actually I'm going to take another relaxed lunch break right here as feeling good accomplishment for getting this corner done, only one more to go.
</p>

<p>
I am in pretty good (surprisingly good actually) spirits right now after that long harvest, but obviously this kind of farm sim playing is totally nuts I mean who harvests 880ha single field for three days straight 16hrs a day? :)
</p>

<p>
Dumped last grain truck loads to railroad silo 4 and now our canola deposit there is 9.031m liters! ;)
</p>

<p>
0343 It is time for a relaxed lunch break, I'll try to start NE last corner after but we will see<br>
0427 Lunch break over
</p>

<p>
Railroad silo 4 is just about full, next grain truck route need to be... well to railroad silo 3 or perhaps directly to farm bin silo, man that is sure is long way for trucks to drive.
</p>

<p>
I could of course load that canola into the train grain wagons, those are 143k liters each and there are twenty of them. That would be 2.860m liters... nice amount but in grand scheme of things still quite low.
</p>

<p>
Decided to record courseplay course from F04 east edge to farm bin silo and back. Then refueled all the vehicles again hehe always the same thing at the beginning of each F04 corner ;)
</p>

<p>
0532 Started harvesting canola F04 NE, courseplay ETA 3h 18min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
Here we go again, courseplay shows over three hours duration which I know will be twice as more in real life hours. I'm in a good mood, perhaps even enthusiastic to get this field done althrough I do realize it most likely wont happen on this gaming session. But all in all, lets enjoy the harvest and see how this last corner starts to shape up.
</p>

<p>
0803 Was getting kind of bored again, its been a long day of harvesting F04, time to call it a night. We continue tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2038 Back in PMC Gaming and FS19 booted up, lets finish this F04 canola harvest! :)
</p>

<p>
Feeling enthusiastic for today because the F04 will definitely be finished. As said many times F04 is 880ha big boy, so when I have gotten used to harvesting one field for THREE days straight, going back to those puny less than 200ha fields is like a cake walk, like stealing candy from a baby :)
</p>

<p>
I mean lets say I would harvest one of those tiny 55ha or even smaller fields next, it would feel like "WHOAH what happened? we finished already!?" type of thing heh. Its all about how you adapt into new standards and norm. When 880ha field harvest for three days becomes a norm, doing tiny fields is ridiculously easy.
</p>

<p>
But still, man what a beast that 880ha has been, that is for today (2019-11-09) I have never ever before harvested field this big. In FS17 Cornbelt did the 600ha field and in FS19 PMC Grande Gardens 16km I did F56 (527.960 ha) and F22 (611.811 ha).
</p>

<p>
History will be made tonight! :-)
</p>

<p>
2137 In-game 2142hrs (pretty close heh) night is falling, need to time accelerate until morning daylight<br>
2145 Recorded new grain truck courseplay course for F04 NE center
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-10T0047</b> Finished harvesting canola F04 NE<br>
</p>

<p>
It was awesome feeling getting this 880ha beast of a field done. History was made, now I can say I have prepared, seeded and harvested 880ha field.
</p>

<p>
F04 NE corner harvest was dumped into farm bin silo, there are now 2.757m liters of canola, railroad silo 4 has the existing 9.031m liters (total 11,789,746).
</p>

<p>
0125 Started harvesting canola F38, courseplay ETA 1h 30min, 4x tools<br>
0252 Was getting bored so lunch break came to excatly the right time<br>
0319 Lunch break over, we push on for F38 harvest
</p>

<p>
Just noticed that F05 AI owner is seeding soybeans currently :)
</p>

<p>
The field cost 5.218m and has been on my purchase list for quite some time now, in fact I have been holding on to my money right now waiting for this harvest season to be over before committing into new land purchases. Now that this field is going to be soybeans I am most definitely going to buy it as harvesting that field I'm getting my money invested to the land back for sure :)
</p>

<p>
0455 Finished harvesting canola F38
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo has now 4.120m liters of canola.
</p>

<p>
Did some chores, transferred fertilizer from fert factory to seed factory and seeds from seed factory to farm bin silo, so the factory can produce more seeds. More is good, yes?
</p>

<p>
Refueled and repaired combines and auger wagon tractor. Then there was nothing for me to do, well not really. I got 3 fields fallow, 3 growing soybeans and 5 growing corn. Sure I could go herbicide spray cherry pick style some more but I decided against the whack-a-mole game, I could blanket spray these newly harvested fields but nah don't feel like it right now.
</p>

<p>
Time acceleration until next field is ready to harvest.
</p>

<p>
0535 Another hardware glitch (electric) and had to reset whole computer.
</p>

<p>
Something funky going on with F05 soybeans, HALF of the field is growing soybeans and other half is just cultivated, umm wonder what happened there. Hmm even half of the field is still good, but I must say this kind of put me off a bit, we'll see about purchasing this field hmm.
</p>

<p>
After short consideration I decided to buy the field as you just cant ignore such huge deal. The amount of soybeans I get from that field even its in half seeded poor condition will still be insane amount of liters and that sold... wow that pile of money I'm going to get.
</p>

<p>
0618 Purchased land lot with F05 in it for 5.218m
</p>

<p>
My new F05 is 1205.61ha according to in-game field info (land area 1304.56ha). The soybeans are not fertilized and they are growing some weeds too, but I am not going to bother taking care of these issues as this is just free money for me now, no reason to put in extra work on it.
</p>

<p>
17/late-summer, soybean and corn planting season is over. Now we just wait and time accelerate until we get to harvest our crops.
</p>

<p>
Weeds were growing pretty nasty especially in F24, but because I tried the cherry picking earlier I'm going to wait until the next seasons before I start to blanket spray all the fields. Sure its dumb to care for your fields... except not spray them properly, but yeah, like said...
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn alright we are in soybean and corn harvest season now, crops are still growing, we are waiting.
</p>

<p>
02/early-autumn in-game 0727hrs soybean fields are harvest ready, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
Because F05 is some odd/bugged I need to manually drive courseplay outlines just for this harvest. First need to cut lines so I can drive like pickup truck recording that course.
</p>

<p>
0727 Started harvesting soybeans F05 by GPS driving cutting a line<br>
0748 Finished cutting the line<br>
0752 Lunch break, exited from FS19 as really need to take a break heh<br>
0845 Done cooking and eating, lunch break over
</p>

<p>
0848 Started cutting second line<br>
0908 Finished cutting the line
</p>

<p>
Next used pickup truck to record three courseplay courses for north, center and south outlines. That took a while, funny to think how long combining the contents of the outlines will take heh.
</p>

<p>
0958 Started harvesting soybeans F05 N, courseplay ETA 3h 5min, 4x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
So I bought F05 for 5.2 million, then I split the soybeans to three sections and being harvested the first section not even half... I already had half of the field price in my farm bin silo as soybean grain ready to sell. Hehe I am going to make so much money of this soybeans on top of owning this huge piece of land it is simply insane.
</p>

<p>
1214 Getting tired, been up and playing over 16hrs straight... time to call it a night
</p>

<p>
2330 New farming day has started, PMC Gaming up, FS19 up, we are ready for soybean harvest!
</p>

<p>
Today I was in good mood as usual and very enthusiastic of farming PMC Grande Gardens 16km. I could not wait to get into harvesting. Obviously this is now just early morning enthusiasm as I cannot finish F05 harvest today, its almost the same size as previous F04 and that took me what three days to harvest. My enthusiasm is to finish all the soybeans and corn, all harvest for this year/season, but obviously that will be far into next week before its done if I play every day :)
</p>

<p>
I'm just having a great time harvesting soybeans now, its not even bothering me to know that this field will not be finished today, I'm enjoying every minute one at the time :)
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-11T0138</b> Finished harvesting soybeans F05 N
</p>

<p>
0154 Started harvesting soybeans F05 Center, courseplay ETA 3h 33min, 4x tools<br>
0442 Lunch break, but this time the soybean harvest is a bit slower pace so I'm trying to eat while play...<br>
0508 All feeded up, lets get back to the farming with both hands<br>
</p>

<p>
Both hands? Well when you're driving a grain cart auger wagon tractor and eating at the same time its quite difficult. When playing singleplayer with courseplay its often much of boring waiting, like those tv episode or even movie length field works where you need to do <i>nothing</i>, for example cultivating, plowing or fertilizer spraying with big enough tank etc. Then you can relax and eat multiple times during one of these field works.
</p>

<p>
However harvesting with my current setup, 4x claas lexion 8900s with midwest durus 18m header, two grain trucks under courseplay course and me driving manually fendt 1050 with elmers haulmaster 70k liter auger wagon to empty the combines into trucks... that is hands on job constantly.
</p>

<p>
There are few downtimes of literally less than 30sec or so which is used to ALT-TAB unless I want to be bored staring at the screen waiting for combines to fill up, which I almost never do I always ALT-TAB to check out something in the background, for example writing THIS text heh.
</p>

<p>
So to sum it up, the massive harvest operations in F04 kept me really busy hands on all the time, that is why I wanted to take a clean break for eating so I don't have to stress over my combines getting full and me losing precious harvesting time heh.
</p>

<p>
0721 Finished harvesting soybeans F05 Center
</p>

<p>
0726 Short break<br>
0824 Okay almost one hour break is now over
</p>

<p>
02/early-autumn in-game 1934hrs night is quickly falling, lets time accelerate until the morning light.
</p>

<p>
Refueled combines, they were getting a bit low. Auger wagon and trucks are fine. Oddly enough my todays starter enthusiasm, is all but gone, don't feel like playing much but its one of those things that if I stop playing now... what else would I do heh.
</p>

<p>
0845 Started harvesting soybeans F05 S, courseplay ETA 3h 33min, 4x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
After harvesting a while I checked farm bin silo contents for soybeans, it was 3.893m liters which is quite crazy amount just from this land purchase "bonus". So I calculated how much profit do I get now even though the field is not finished yet, I almost fell outta my chair when I saw it was fifteen million! I'm getting my money back what I paid for this land lot and extra TEN million! haha I love this stuff :-)
</p>

<p>
1036 Its been a long day, decided to call it a night. More farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
2159 Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 started up, lets wrap up F05 harvest.
</p>

<p>
I was really excited and enthusiastic to start play today, as usual. Cannot wait to get this F05 soybean harvest wrapped up and then to move on my own seeded fields.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-12T0124</b> Finished harvesting soybeans F05 S<br>
</p>

<p>
That F05 (half+) was quite the harvest, but really strange that it didn't feel too overwhelming. Its difficult to say how many hectares of soybeans did I harvest the field is 1205ha but it was only half way seeded like maybe 60% seeded for unknown reason.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to relocate my harvesting fleet to east at F29. Also the usual maintenance repairs, refueling etc chores for the farmer heh.
</p>

<p>
0159 Harvesting fleet relocated and refueled
</p>

<p>
F05 soybean harvest got me 5.451m liters, oh wow that converted with best market price to cash comes to 21.215m yes twenty one million hehe. So if we deduct the cost of the initial land purchase we get 15.997 million of profit, now is that crazy or what? WHOAH! :)
</p>

<p>
I'm going to haul soybeans from F29 into railroad silo 4 which is right next to the field. I kind of wanted to put the soybeans in farm bin silo, but its way too far away.
</p>

<p>
0220 Started harvesting soybeans F29, courseplay ETA 1h 32min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
Felt good to be harvesting my own field work seeded soybeans, yes sure F05 is my field too but its just not the same if you get such bonus crop when purchasing a land lot. All the work hours and effort I put into F29 really makes the soybean harvest so much more rewarding.
</p>

<p>
0242 Lunch break, this time again shutting down FS19 for the duration...<br>
0313 Alright feeding done, lets get back to farming<br>
0316 It started to rain, except not... rain icon and combines stopped but no rain in 3D anywhere in sight. Hmm
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated over the rain, in-game 1853hrs crops were wet so have to wait.
</p>

<p>
Canola went into high demand on selling point 4, the price was 2622 which is like three hundred better than what I've normally seen the highest.
</p>

<p>
Now comes in a problem... PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 train network and train unloading is broken, so I cannot transfer crops using trains before I fix the terrain. This high demand would be awesome to sell but I cannot now... unless I edit the savegame XML files and magically just sell the canola by removing it from my bins and translating it to money.
</p>

<p>
This is borderline cheating because you not only skip the train hauling but also truck hauling (hey no way I'm going to haul 10+ million liters in a truck!), but as said... terrain is buggy, its not my fault (err) that I cannot sell my crops.
</p>

<p>
Currently I have canola in farm bin silo 4,120,196 liters and in railroad silo 4 whopping 9,031,805 liters.
</p>

<p>
After some consideration I decided to do it. Going to edit savegame XMLs and transfer canola to money. Don't call me a cheater when the frigging terrain is bugged, fix your terrain or shut the hell up! :-)
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo had 4120196 liters railroad silo 4 9031805 liters == 13,152,001 liters. 13152 x 2622 == 34,484,544 for crying out loud. My current money is 1,764,402 so I simply removed all of the canola and incremented my money with that sick 34.4 million, total cash now 36,248,946 haha, uuuh! :-)
</p>

<p>
I really must say that feels so much cheating that its 50/50 flip of a coin for me how I see it, but it was explained and I made my decision, good or bad, it is done.
</p>

<p>
0353 Back in-game with 36.245m in cash MUHAHAH! ok ok, harvest continues ;)<br>
0604 Finished harvesting soybeans F29
</p>

<p>
F29 soybean harvest was 1.120m liters, pretty nice haul.
</p>

<p>
0635 Need to take another lunch break here...<br>
0742 Okay break is over, hmm what next
</p>

<p>
Money was burning hole in my pocket, I cant resist the urge to go shopping! shopping! ;)
</p>

<p>
0743 Purchased land lot with:<br>
F30 in it for 6.310m<br>
F12-F14 in it for 976.9k<br>
F15 in it for 612k<br>
F16-F18 in it for 1.056m<br>
F03, F89-F92 in it for 4.126m<br>
F10 in it for 266.9k<br>
F11 in it for 291.2k<br>
F19 in it for 269.7k<br>
F01, F02, F31 and F32 in it for 1.555m<br>
F20 in it for 1.298m<br>
F21 in it for 1.308m<br>
F22 in it for 2.609m<br>
F50 in it for 964.9k<br>
F49 in it for 1.133m<br>
F48 in it for 1.119m<br>

F45 in it for 411.3k<br>
F44 in it for 618.5k<br>
F43 in it for 245.7k<br>
F42 in it for 236.4k<br>
F41 in it for 247.1k<br>
F51 in it for 1.818m<br>
F52 in it for 1.096m<br>
F83 and F84 in it for 712.9k<br>
F86 in it for 104.6k<br>
F85 in it for 95.5k<br>
F87 and F88 in it for 573.9k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 5.148m heh. That is a whole lotta land! :)
</p>

<p>
I could have bought one more land lot from the southern edge of the terrain but why bother. Its good to leave some buffer money for vehicles like herbicide sprayers and low boy trucks are necessary, dunno if I expand my vehicle fleet into the NW and NE regions already, we'll see, well not with this 5 million anyway (I think).
</p>

<p>
Yeah this land purchase frenzy felt <i>so</i> gooooood! Heh its bizarre but I love shopping for hardware or some other such stuff in real life so this virtual land shopping spree was really nice too hehe.
</p>

<p>
On quick look we have few fields that have been seeded or even harvest ready, few of those fields were soybeans and canola, rest some useless time waste like wheat, oats not to mention garbage like sugar beets and potatoes which I'm going to plow under for sure.
</p>

<p>
Now I own HALF of this terrain, pretty accurately even as the field lines go nicely along the center axis too. Well half minus F40 the megalodon. Future field purchases has to be made after I tweak the _farmland image because remaining land lots are just huge with ten or so million price tags. Its not so much about the money but it is just lazy and ugly to have those huge _farmland image areas.
</p>

<p>
New fields with growing or harvest ready soybeans are F02, F46, F51 and canola F32, F44. Rest are as said trashy crops, I might take a nibble out of wheat field for seed factory but I most certainly wont be wasting my time any longer than necessary.
</p>

<p>
Its difficult to explain but these purchases are very exciting, getting the progress on the savegame but also I now have the old fields I got familiar with in my previous career savegames, so its kind of like returning home heh.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm excited to have this many fields what I have never ever have until now (FS19). How does such massive amount of fields effect my field work time, like do I start to run out of seasons 24 days duration to get fields prepared and seeded, who knows.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about it more now, I think its fairly certain I need to make my current vehicles as NW region and start purchasing vehicle fleet NE slowly, its just crazy to drive your vehicles back and forth with 16km terrain distances, you need vehicles which are dedicated to their own assigned area.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, exciting times indeed farmer ;)
</p>

<p>
0818 Started harvesting soybeans F24, courseplay ETA 1h 14min, 4x tools<br>
1006 Finished harvesting soybeans F24
</p>

<p>
Railroad silo 4 has 1.915m liters of soybeans, so F24 harvest was about 795k liters.
</p>

<p>
1024 Decided to call it a night, have few chores to do before bed time. More farming tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-13T0033</b> New farming day has begun. Harvesting continues!
</p>

<p>
Immediately after entering the game it started to rain but it was not raining when I saved game last night, hmm. Even the soil moisture icon was not there and appeared after like 10-20 seconds. Sky was totally clear not a cloud in sight. This feels like buggy game or seasons behavior to me. Not a big deal of course, but if such thing as weather is buggy upon game restart... wonder what else.
</p>

<p>
I was very excited to play again which is weird as I just played last night, sure I ended it up a bit early and watched some TV to finish the day off, but still. Always nice to be fresh for new days of farming heh. Today I have one more soybean left from my old fields, then the still growing corn fields. The new soybean fields are far away so after this harvest I'm going to decide about buying first vehicles for the NE region fleet.
</p>

<p>
First need to time accelerate a bit to get over the rain and wet soil so we can get started with F25 soybean harvest. When its underway it should go by quickly, small 70 some-hectare field, piece of cake.
</p>

<p>
0049 Started harvesting soybeans F25, courseplay ETA 1h 13min, 4x tools<br>
0321 Finished harvesting soybeans F25
</p>

<p>
That concludes my own existing fields soybean harvest. Now I still have few of the new canola and soybean fields to do.
</p>

<p>
0328 Need to take a break for planning what to harvest next, also lunch break I think...<br>
0633 Break if over!
</p>

<p>
Purchased some real life hardware which took a while. Now back to farming, lets see how we are going to deal with those new fields, should we wait until our own corn fields are ready to harvest or what hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Decided to go harvest F02 soybeans first. Honestly I pretty much forgot about the plans to buy vehicles for NE sector fleet, so I just sent my existing harvester fleet towards F02 heh.
</p>

<p>
Refueling becomes a problem now, these beast's drink so much fuel and the thundercreek trailer while its great... its just not capable enough to provide fuel for this many vehicles and driving that pesky pickup 1978 truck back and forth seems silly. I need some 32k liter truck tanker trailer. I downloaded one but it was that kind of dumb european looking and haven't even tested it yet if its any good, zero error policy and all.
</p>

<p>
I was planning on buying another PMC Farm Bin Silo large and place it to the same coordinates I had it on my other savegame (seasons test) which allows me to use the existing courseplay courses. Dunno how to place it though, I cant remember the exact spot and while I have to edit items.xml for coords, dunno how the terrain sculpting thing does it leave ugly mark on the initial test spot heh.
</p>

<p>
Actually I want to buy all the vehicle shelters too which I used in the other save, kind of like recreating the mood from that save into this save, heh cooky.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another PMC Farm Bin Silo large and silo extension, two vehicle shelter 2 types and four vehicle shelter 3 types. Then saved game and edited items.xml to place them to the exact coordinates they were in my seasons test savegame. Had to do some landscaping painting but it was fine, on the next terrain upgrade I lose these landscaping edits anyways.
</p>

<p>
Now I have 22 million liters of farm bin silo capacity. Divided by the original farm by the F39 and this new one by F19. Good luck keeping tabs which silo has how much and what grains haha, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 4.681m
</p>

<p>
0909 Time for a lunch break...
</p>

<p>
Well one chore lead to another after cooking food and feeding myself that I ran out of time to properly continue playing, I had like hour and a half time left before bed time so decided its not worth to start up PMC Gaming and FS19 for such a quick gaming session.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-14T0139</b> New farming day has begun, PMC Gaming up, FS19 up, lets get to it.

0150 Started harvesting soybeans F02, courseplay ETA 1h 26min, 4x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
Again it felt great to be back farming as it feels on most mornings heh. Another great farming day has started, cant wait to see what we can accomplish today.
</p>

<p>
0411 Finished harvesting soybeans F02
</p>

<p>
Alright another soybean field done. Soybean farm bin silos are now 6.306m liters and railroad silo 4 2.672m liters. I cant tell how much is on the farm 1 bin and in farm 2 bin.
</p>

<p>
Next field to go is F51 harvest ready soybeans. Nice 360ha size field heh, it will take a few hours to harvest. Need to dump grain into railroad silo 6 which is right next to the field, will be quick single truck operation.
</p>

<p>
Then had to transfer all my vehicles into F51 which was quite the ordeal, slow combines 42kph driving even through stupid sugar beet fields were just taking so long time to get there.
</p>

<p>
Idea was to try eight (8) combines in one field, I don't think it will be practical or even work maybe the crap FS19 engine loses all FPS performance to the courseplay hired workers we'll see. But at least I want to try it out so I can be able to say I did it.
</p>

<p>
0607 Started harvesting soybeans F51, courseplay ETA 2h 47min, <b>8x tools</b><br>

1223 Finished harvesting soybeans F51
</p>

<p>
Whoah that was some harvest with 8x claas lexion 8900s with midwest durus 18m headers! :)
</p>

<p>
Total soybeans in the railroad silos 4 and now 6 is 5.372m heh and the same as before for farm bin silo 6.306m which is total of 11.678 damn million liters! :-)
</p>

<p>
How about if we don't calculate how much money that will makes us heh, have to keep it as surprise, but yeah it will be <i>decent</i> amount :)
</p>

<p>
1248 Anyways its been a long day, time to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-15T0407</b> New farming day has started, wonder what we get to harvest today :)
</p>

<p>
Brought pickup truck 1978 to F51 and refueled almost 4 lexion 8900s, ran out of fuel in FST990, damn I need a <del>bigger boat</del> diesel fuel transport vehicle. Used the pickup to record courseplay courses from F51 to F46 which will be my next harvest destination.
</p>

<p>
Need to figure out some farm location in the NE where I can house my NE vehicle fleet.
</p>

<p>
Took a long time driving pickup truck 1978 from shop to F51 when bringing those midwest durus header trailers as I had a slight mishap with store delivery mod location when buying the trailers heh.
</p>

<p>
0547 Purchased diesel fuel placeable for 5.9k, placed it to farm 2 (in the center or so terrain)<br>
0627 Relocated vehicle fleet NE to F88 which is harvest ready sunflowers
</p>

<p>
Night time had fallen so time accelerated to morning daylight, its now 06/early-autumn in-game 0725hrs.
</p>

<p>
F88 was so ridiculously small 4ha so I decided to harvest the sunflowers with single combine me driving using GPS.
</p>

<p>
0632 Started harvesting sunflowers F88, using GPS
</p>

<p>
After that megalomaniac 8x lexion 8900s monster harvest of 360ha it was actually nice to do such a small field and drive the combine myself. Now obviously this is just a nice change once in a while, I would never start to harvest larger field than single digit (even 9ha might be quite big already) like this, we have courseplay with multiple tools for a reason.
</p>

<p>
When I have been playing arma3, elite or edited for weeks or months its always nice to get back to farmsim again. When this happens I often like to start small like "appreciate the little things" for example just small terrain with small starter vehicles. I loath the tiny terrains and especially those gamey console loser giants "maps" but then again great 4km terrains like Midwest Horizon or even PMC's own north dakota greendale... they are already too big <i>for starter type appreciation of the little things</i>, for my returning to farmsim purpose. Uhm difficult to explain.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time with massive large scale farming I'm in 3rd person view and often quite high camera zoomed out too so I can monitor the combines etc going around the field. So thats why I sometimes miss these down to earth small scale stuff you sitting in the combines cab right next to the ground and crops :)
</p>

<p>
0659 Finished harvesting sunflowers F88<br>
0711 Started harvesting barley F87, using GPS<br>
0735 Finished harvesting barley F87
</p>

<p>
Dumped the sunflowers and barley into railroad silo 2, wonder if I ever remember I did that and just always wonder "why is there sunflowers in my bin but I cant find which one!?" hehe.
</p>

<p>
06/early-autumn in-game 0923hrs it was raining, weather forecast shows raining at noon. Time accelerated until rain ended.
</p>

<p>
06/early-autumn in-game 1822hrs soil is dry, we are ready to start harvesting F85 and F46, but uh oh its early evening and not many hours of daylight left, but hopefully can at least get small 4ha F85 done before the dark.
</p>

<p>
1014 Started harvesting soybeans F85, using GPS<br>
? Finished harvesting soybeans F85
</p>

<p>
1038 Purchased PMC farm bin silo large, placed it east side of F85. Budget now 131.1k
</p>

<p>
Was looking around where to dump the grain from upcoming F46 harvest and realized this NE sector does need its own farm bin silo because there is so many big fields around this area. So placed one next to F85 which had a nice flat terrain. This will be now my NE sector main farm and bin.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to have four sectors NW, NE, SW and SE where I purchase individual vehicle fleets. These vehicles of course need a farm headquarters even though I'm not much into the role play of parking vehicles into shelters when done not to mention the useless silly washing of vehicles, so some kind of location with vehicle shelter or two near the bin silo would be nice. Hell if nothing else they are a nice landmark to navigate towards :)
</p>

<p>
1043 Purchased two CBJ vehicle shelters 72x150 white shed for 35k each, budget now 61.1k
</p>

<p>
1102 Need to take a break, to go pickup my hardware delivery :)<br>
1222 Alright hardware picked up as well as groceries for the weekend, now we continue farming.
</p>

<p>
Recorded courseplay courses for grain truck F46, also generated combine harvester field work course for F46, all good to go for the medium size harvest. But before that I need to skip the night and at the same time going to take a quick break to unbox my hardware, I want to get new headphones in use :)
</p>

<p>
1348 Break over, harvest will commence. In-game 1930hrs and still some daylight, decided to go as long as it gets dark<br>
1350 Started harvesting soybeans F46, courseplay ETA 2h 4min, 4x tools<br>
1459 Night had fallen, in-game 2039hrs I cant see the combines, lets time accelerate to the morning daylight<br>
1700 Lunch break...<br>
1739 Break is over, lets finish F46!<br>
1803 Finished harvesting soybeans F46
</p>

<p>
Soybean storage farm bin silo 7.345m and railroad silos 5.372m liters (total 12.717m). Now we wait until NW corn or NE canola is harvest ready.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-autumn in-game 0759hrs all corn fields are ready to harvest.
</p>

<p>
1849 Purchased diesel fuel placeable for 5.9k, placed it next to CBJ vehicle shelter in NE.
</p>

<p>
1919 Started harvesting corn F43, courseplay ETA 1h 5min, 4x tools<br>
1945 My eyes are shutting down, cant keep myself awake, time to call it a night, we'll finish F43 tomorrow
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-16T0236</b> New farming day has started, we continue F43 corn harvest!
</p>

<p>
0403 Finished harvesting corn F43
</p>

<p>
Took a quick lunch break here. Next is to switch back to NW vehicle fleet sector for those harvest ready corn fields. So I recorded courseplay course from F51 to Farm 1 using semi truck (fast), then sent other truck, auger wagon and combines behind it.
</p>

<p>
Used semi truck to put some barley into seed factory, then few loads of seeds from the factory to farm bin silo so that there is empty space in the factory to produce more seeds. Logistics baby, all about large scale farming.
</p>

<p>
Too bad PMC Farm Bin Large does not show fertilizer and seed in the crop market prices menu, wonder if that has something to do with the actual selling points not accepting it, hmm?
</p>

<p>
0607 Rubicon 9000 started to refill from farmer_schubi's liquid fertilizer factory and ZZZZUP, game froze up. <b>sigh</b><br>

</p>

<p>
It rained in the night, so 11/mid-autumn in-game 0855hrs crops were wet. Okay lets wait until they dry up, at least weather forecast have no more rain now. In-game 1308hrs soil/crops are dry, harvest continues.

<p>
Loading the savegame career after this break it was 400hrs played, heh nice. Many people don't play farmsim that much in their life and I clock it on one single savegame hehe.
</p>

<p>
1449 Night is falling, again. So we time accelerate until morning daylight<br>
1801 Weather forecast shows rain for RIGHT NOW, actual weather status is cloudy and rain coming soon...<br>
1819 Finished harvesting corn F33
</p>

<p>
Whoah that was some corn harvest day! More than 15hrs straight! :)
</p>

<p>
1834 Alright time to call it a night, not sure if I continue tomorrow somehow I feel exhausted and want to do some editing soon... hmm...
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-18T0509</b> New farming day has started, PMC Gaming and FS19 is up. Corn harvest time!
</p>

<p>
The plan was to start terrain editing today (well I am downloading terra incognita satellite imagery as we speak) but after waking up with enthusiasm and then reading what the idiots on the internet are saying again... I decided to go to my happy place and that is PMC Grande Gardens 16km corn harvest :)
</p>

<p>
Now we have 2x 50ha and 55ha fields of corn left. My goal is to finish at least F34 (55ha) and F23 (50ha) today, if I cannot do that for whatever reason then I'm disappointed. I'm hoping to finish the whole corn harvest today so also F27, but we'll see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
Once the corn harvest is done, then we still have two fields of canola F32 and F44 which are larger and other side of the terrain. I definitely do not expect to get those done and I doubt I even get started with F32 today. Oh well too much speculation, lets get started with the corn harvest and go one field at the time, shall we.
</p>

<p>
Something has been bugging in this savegame since I activated platinum edition claas DLC and leased some telehandler or something for just a few minutes, ever since that I have gotten nightly vehicle running costs, which just seem to increase by the time goes on. I do not have any leased vehicles, yes I have checked.
</p>

<p>
As listed above I have sickening amount of grain in my various bin silos, millions and millions worth... but due the nightly costs I actually ran out of CASH money now. I was setupping my vehicles for F34 corn harvest and when refueling thundercreek FST990 I ran out of money heh.
</p>

<p>
I could take a truck and sell one load of corn to the selling point 8 which is the closest, but I am so lazy that I just loan 5k so at least I can fill up the thundercreek with one set of fuel now. Start From Zero is about not taking loan yes I know that, but this is just silly as I have probably 30+ million worth of grain in the silos and even driving the truck off from its courseplay course would take too long heh, so taking a quick loan is easier to fill the thundercreek :)
</p>

<p>
Going to sell off the first truck load off F34 to selling point 8 to make some cash money for daily operations. And damn I need to fix that nightly vehicle running costs it is bleeding me dry and its a bug in the first place.
</p>

<p>
0607 All vehicles refueled, we are good to go<br>
0608 Started harvesting corn F34, courseplay ETA 1h 18min, 4x tools<br>
0637 Sold corn in selling point 8 for 49.5k + 49.5k. This was done to get some money because I got none<br>
0711 Paid the loan off, budget now 91.3k<br>
0919 Finished harvesting corn F34
</p>

<p>
Need to take a lunch break here. At 1005hrs lunch break over, time to get back to harvesting, two more fields to go.
</p>

<p>
Recorded courseplay course for grain truck from F23 to railroad silo 4 which is just nearby. I was shocked to see farm 1 bin silo already having 7.5 million liters of corn so surely we are not going to dump anymore there, also its pretty far away so no reason to drive that much.
</p>

<p>
1020 Started harvesting corn F23, courseplay ETA 1h 12min, 4x tools<br>
1229 Made the decision to stop playing FS19 for a while
</p>

<p>
Huh what?
</p>

<p>
Yeah I have been playing for so long 16hrs/day again that this is just insane, I need to stop and continue arma3 terrain editing and other chores I have queued during this FS19 playing time. Oh and I also edit FS19 but I just have to stop playing it as playing is waste of (perfectly good editing) time.
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid to even scroll up to check how many days straight I have been playing now (and I already played several days in <a href="stories-from-zero-midwest-horizon.php">Start From Zero Midwest Horizon</a> before this). I have always said farmsim is a time sink and I still keep playing, this must end.
</p>

<p>
Obviously I won't stop playing for good but at least cut back completely now, do some editing and next year maybe start to look into <i>playing</i> FS19 again.
</p>

<p>
I am going to finish this corn harvest which is this F23 and then F27, after that its two canola fields F32 (near farm 2) and F44 which is bigger by farm 3. There is no doubt I am going to finish corn harvest today or die trying heh. Not sure about the canola fields, I'm sort of hoping it would last me no longer than HALF day tomorrow... remains to be seen, canola is somewhat quick to harvest with 4x 18m headers.
</p>

<p>
F32 is 46.5ha and F44 is 142.2ha in size. Yeah that fourtyfour will take a few hours to harvest thats for sure. But it will be done. Anyways lets continue the task in hand, corn harvest...
</p>

<p>
1255 Finished harvesting corn F23<br>
1304 Started harvesting corn F27, courseplay ETA 1h 12min, 4x tools<br>
1347 Time accelerated through the night, it was raining and then had to wait until soil/crops are dry<br>
1504 Lunch break...<br>
1541 Feeding done, now its time to finish this corn harvest!<br>
1618 Finished harvesting corn F27
</p>

<p>
Uuaah corn harvest for this year/season is done! :)
</p>

<p>
Corn harvest got me 7.591m liters in farm bin silo and 2.388m liters in railroad silo, man those are crazy amounts of grain heh. I really need to bump up these PMC Grande Gardens 16km silo capacitys because ten million liter even though it sounds cool on paper... its nothing when you really start to rock and roll with harvests :)
</p>

<p>
1634 Exited FS19 to take backups of savegame and small breather break, I do not plan on stopping for today but very short break is in order...<br>
1646 Well that was a long break heh, okay lets attack those canola fields...
</p>

<p>
Then it was just waiting for canola fields to grow, actually I should be able to fertilize them at least once before they are ready to harvest. For F44 that would mean another 45min work and ... well I'm not going to bother driving rubicons down to F32, too lazy for such haul.
</p>

<p>
Canola fields would need a herbicide spraying as well, but yeah not going to happen. I mean we got now so much grain in the bin silos already that doing for example F32 is completely waste of time, the amount of extra money we got from that field <i>changes nothing</i> because most likely when we sell all the grain we can buy all the remaining land in this terrain, so yeah.. but we'll see I'd like to harvest that as canola is one of the most valuable crops.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerating 6000 speed and no growth on F32 or F44. Got to 01/early-winter and still nothing. Then it started to snow, in-game morning when seasons was done syncing after fast forward I heard rain sound but sky was clear and there was no weather rain icon. Then after few moments ground turned to snow covered one heh.
</p>

<p>
Decided to save and restart F19 because I assume there is some sort of desync going on now, lets see what game/seasons wrote into the savegame XMLs...
</p>

<p>
No real change that I could see, I don't want to jump the gun here but canola seems to be frozen in time, kind of like one crop planting was in my other savegame previously, there was just no growth at all. Why would this happen? No idea, I bought the lands where these fields were growing canola already so maybe the buying caused some issue. Or maybe the excessive time accelerating 6000 speed just desynced seasons operations so badly that it could not recover and crops were frozen in time.
</p>

<p>
If the canola got bugged for whatever reason its not a big deal, yeah I did fertilize both fields but it was pretty quick and painless field work so I'm not going to cry about it. Hell to be honest... at this point after playing almost one month straight 16hrs/day I'm pretty much ready to take a FS19 break right here right now hehe. But lets keep time accelerating...
</p>

<p>
One thing though; corn highest market price selling day is quickly approaching, its on around 08/early-winter to 10/mid-winter, I think the best day is 09. If I reach that... then while not necessary I would like to sell my millions liters of corn. But that would require the fixed trains on the new terrain or again kind of cheating by editing the savegame XML. I'm afraid... to save time and agony, its going to be the latter... :)
</p>

<p>
Nightly vehicle running costs have increased already from about 1k to 4.7k now and they keep rising. I haven't figured out where do they come from as I have NO leased vehicles. It must have been some goof up with the platinum edition claas dlc leased vehicles several real life days ago. This must be fixed, I just have no idea how. In the long run this will completely bleed me dry.
</p>

<p>
Corn selling day arrived, 07/early-winter and the price was increasing at 1484. Day after tomorrow historically should be the best day to sell, but on tomorrow might be a good day as well.
</p>

<p>
08/early-winter after in-game 2100hrs corn 1568.
</p>

<p>
09/mid-winter which should be the best selling day... had corn market price actually dropping. I assume this is the randomness in seasons. You should monitor the price, not the day. Obviously its the 07-09 winter days but don't wait for too long (for day 09) as if the price is right on 07 or 08 then just sell.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-winter yep the good sell day was 08 with 1568 price for corn, I did not sell and I lost the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Decided to time accelerate until end of the winter, save game and end playing there.
</p>

<p>
24/late-winter in-game 0717hrs. So here we are end of year dunno is it year two now or first I lost track already heh anyways. As explained many days previously that PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 train system is bugged (cant unload from the trains) and there are no train selling points... I cant really continue playing until these issues are fixed. Also I want to edit many more fixes and upgrades. End of the year/season is the safest place to upgrade terrains and season mod itself to avoid any savegame issues.
</p>

<p>
For the next time playing FS19 I'm going to upgrade into at that time latest seasons mod of course, hopefully then we have new stable version but if not I'll be using the betas. But for now, its time to shut it down and take a break from FS19 for as long as I can :)
</p>

<p>
1922 Saved game, exited FS19, backupped savegames plus other settings.
