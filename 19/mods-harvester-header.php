<p>
Mods Harvester Header for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Combine harvesters in general terms need attached headers to cut the crop, these are generally grain headers but also special root crop harvesters use their own headers. There are so called grain headers and corn/sunflower headers.

Notes: 2019-07-14 tested, no errors. towing the header was a bit funky on hard corner, other than that its fine 13.7m header. Hmm this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwJ1u6jJFs4" target="_blank">youtube video description</a> states antler22 didn't get them to work?

	<h2>Midwest Durus 60ft Combine Header (18m)</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by JavierZzS (iBer). From modDesc: Midwes Durus 60ft. The MidWest Durus is the new series of platforms, released in 2014. MidWest Durus offers the reliability and durability you’ve come to expect from our previous Crophawk model with new features designed to give you optimum harvesting performance.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Notes: If you use New Holland CR10.90 its unloading auger pipe is not long enough to reach auger wagon, courseplay use is impossible. If you use Custom's edited Ideal combine harvester it includes extended unloading auger pipe which works great with this header width (but Custom's Ideal is broken mod).

<p>
Notes: Includes header trailer with a fuel tank. Ideal 9t auger pipe just barely reaches auger wagon, its really close. You can drive grain cart yourself and without issues offload the combine, sure you need to be careful but overall there is no issue with it. Offloading feels a little bit uncomfortable as the auger pipe JUST reaches over the auger wagon edge, but it work and thats what matters.

Notes: corn header 12.3m 13km/h 22k liter grain tank. Required mods john deere S600 and S700 series. However when I browsed around these combines in the shop, some option selection 3d meshes got stuck in the vehicle shop after I purchased one combine. I assume these disappear after next game restart, at least I hope so. This is awesome CORN harvesting combine, it actually makes corn harvesting almost as easy as regular grains.
