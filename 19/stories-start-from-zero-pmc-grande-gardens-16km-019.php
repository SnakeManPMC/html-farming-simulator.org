<p>
Well this massive upgrade to our farm land lots and equipment should last us for couple of harvests maybe. I think our plowing and cultivating strenght is a bit weak so we'll see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking of doing one harvest with PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 and once I have mega amounts of crops in farm bin silo and possibly in some railroad silos, I can then do the terrain edits and upgrade terrain <i>plus</i> seasons savegame which definitely is not going to be easy.
</p>

<pre>
- cultivator 400hp 20m john deere 2410 5 section 75k
</pre>
<p>
1059 Purchased above as my fleet was one short.
</p>

<p>
1126 Started fertilizing F39, courseplay ETA 40min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
In some odd way after all that time spent harvesting... it felt refreshing, really good to be back in "regular" field work like fertilizing, heh sounds strange I know. I bet this mood quickly passes when we get into those 2hrs+ courseplay ETA's haha
</p>

<p>
For crop rotation I made a field info list of all my fields now, but still trying to learn to memorize all that legume, oilseed, nightshade and fallow stuff so I can just take a glance at the mapview and right away know what to seed/plant next or if I need to leave the field fallow.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if seasons crop rotation is just the extra layer of fertilization, or do I get yield penalty even with 100% fertilized, limed, plowed and 0% weeds when I spam the same crop type over and over again. Seasons manual does not state anything regarding this, I think it assumes users "get it" fully from the crop rotation planner menu tool. Edit: yes crop rotation gives you penalty even with everything 100% ok if you just keep spamming like soybeans every year.
</p>

<p>
1215 Finished fertilizing F39<br>
1217 The game froze when started refilling rubicon 9000 from utts-32000 tanker, as usual<br>
1223 Once again finished fertilizing F39 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy"><br>
1225 Unbelievable! Drove rubicons and tanker truck next to F38, saved game, started to refill first rubicon and ZZZZUP, freeze <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy"><br>
1228 Started fertilizing F38, courseplay ETA 30min, 2x tools<br>
1308 Finished fertilizing F38<br>
1319 Started lime spreading F39, courseplay ETA 1h 25min, 3x tools
</p>

<p>
Three lime spreader vehicles and still it takes movie duration to do this medium sized field, heck I consider this to be small field.
</p>

<p>
1320 Started fertilizing F37, courseplay ETA 20min, 2x tools<br>
1343 Finished fertilizing F37<br>
1345 Started fertilizing F36, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
1407 Finished fertilizing F36<br>
1414 Started fertilizing F35, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
1416 Started ploughing F36, courseplay ETA 1h 25min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Surprising how relatively little time it takes to plow this field, I was expecting my first 2hrs+ ETA. Well not to worry, those are coming soon hehe.
</p>

<p>
Then performance went to crap, had 7 vehicles running under courseplay courses (so hired AI) and 20 FPS, oh man it was awful to play a game with such performance <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Don't want to sound overly dramatic but everytime this 20 FPS crap performance happens I get the immediate feeling of just shutting down and uninstalling FS19 because why would you play a game with well, unplayable performance. 20 FPS is like vic-20 in the early 80's <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1437 Finished fertilizing F35<br>
1438 Started fertilizing F34, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
1501 Finished fertilizing F34<br>
1505 Started fertilizing F33, courseplay ETA 1h 5min, 2x tools<br>
1517 Finished lime spreading F39<br>
1519 Started lime spreading F38, courseplay ETA 1h 5min, 3x tools<br>
1550 Finished ploughing F36<br>
1552 Started ploughing F35, courseplay ETA 1h 25min, 2x tools<br>
1618 Finished fertilizing F33<br>
1634 Finished lime spreading F38<br>
1636 Started lime spreading F37, courseplay ETA 39min, 3x tools<br>
1641 Started fertilizing F04, courseplay ETA 4h 2min, 2x tools<br>
1721 Finished lime spreading F37<br>
1727 Finished ploughing F35
</p>

<p>
Seems like lime spreading and plowing tasks ended within minutes of each other and now I have a long wait because I need fertilizing but the rubicons are tied up on F04 like close to four hours heh. I could of course go load bredals with solid fertilizer and continue, hmm we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Took Big Bud 450 and went to fix small plow line on south edge of F33. It makes no difference in yields but pisses me off as there is nasty red line for no reason, this will fix it. Also fixed couple of missed spots and corners on F34-F36 and eastern edge line on F34.
</p>

<p>
1816 Started lime spreading F34, courseplay ETA 37min, 3x tools<br>
1858 Finished lime spreading F34
</p>

<p>
At this point the rubicons on F04 still had 2hrs to go and I decided to go watch some TV in the mean time. Yes I know I know, courseplay playing the game for your while you leave the computer is... no way of farming, but I literally have nothing to do here except watch rubicons drive back and forth especially when there is the constant fear of game freezes if I would start go goof around something. So TV it is at least for this time.
</p>

<p>
2105 Finished fertilizing F04, well still have to fix SE corner but...<br>
2127 Lunch break and tv watching over, 24/late-autumn in-game 1902hrs its dark, time acceleration until morning
</p>

<p>
Took a few moments but the SE corner was finished.
</p>
