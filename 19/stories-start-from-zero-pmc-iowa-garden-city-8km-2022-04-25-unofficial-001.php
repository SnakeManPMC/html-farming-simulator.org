	<h2>2022-04-25 Getting Started With Cultivating Contracts</h2>

<p>
2022-04-25T16:26:01Z I just fired up Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) in a long time, honestly cannot remember if I played <a href="stories-from-zero-grande-gardens.php">Start From Zero PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a> this year, hmm it feels like it was last year heh just cant remember. I have done way too much FS22 under that atrocious garbage Windows 10. No more. Enough.
</p>

<p>
Now I need to re-learn all the good FS19 stuff, for example I hardly recognize and remember FS19 Seasons mod anymore, plus many other things, I was baffled of the mod list I saw in my computer that <i>"what are these mods, huh?"</i> heh.
</p>

<p>
I am truly ashamed of my behavior as I spent good part of 2022 editing and playing FS22 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So while I have already played, two or was it three (3) Start From Zero's in <a href="pmc-iowa-garden-city-8km.php">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km</a>, I am going to start one more, not because it needs to be done but just because I like that game-play style and I need to re-learn so many FS19 things and only thing to achieve it is playing.
</p>

<p>
Did farm manager career, set it up in-game options, chose 3 day seasons option, saved game and exited. Then edited savegame files for usual zero setup.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T16:35:35Z Actually started to play now. Lets do it.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T16:36:11Z Accepted contract for cultivating F151
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T16:37:19Z Started cultivating F151, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1638.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1638.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Not much time to write stories while driving manually <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Feels good to be back in garden city and FS19 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T16:56:26Z It was time to watch youtube real life farming videos while playing FS19, just like the good old times <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:15:47Z Finished cultivating F151, contract, collected contract reward 4k.
</p>

<p>
Heh 4k, wow that is peanuts hah, oh well we continue <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:18:14Z Accepted contract for cultivating F154
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:19:33Z Started cultivating F154, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1733.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1733.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:38:16Z Finished cultivating F154, contract, collected contract reward 3.1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:46:54Z Accepted contract for cultivating F148
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T17:48:15Z Started cultivating F148, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1754.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1754.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:08:50Z Finished cultivating F148, contract, collected contract reward 3k.
</p>

<p>
These contract rewards are quite substantive (not) heh. I just earlier today played in <a href="../22/stories-start-from-zero-spring-creek-12km.php">Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km</a> terrain by ARG_Afb and in FS22 I had mod loaded called extra contract reward or something, this mod dates back to the early days of FS22 probably late nov early dec, I do not agree with such mod anymore and it was mistake to have it loaded. This caused my standards to be associated with such ridiculous contract rewards, I made just crazy amount of money in just one days game play (two half days in real time I guess).
</p>

<p>
Now these cultivating contracts when they pay 3k it feels like, err what kind of nonsense is this hah, slave labor! Rip off! Outrage! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
We keep working, gotta get some farming time in iowa garden city again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 10.2k, broken magical two digit number heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:13:13Z Accepted contract for cultivating F153
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:14:23Z Started cultivating F153, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1827.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:38:57Z Finished cultivating F153, contract. Didn't collect the contract because I wanted to use this fendt 1050 vario and whatever yellow wide cultivator on some other contract field as well, this is enjoyable tractor + cultivator combination currently.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:40:50Z Accepted contract for cultivating F147
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:42:21Z Started cultivating F147, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T18:51:49Z Finished cultivating F147, contract, collected contract reward 2.8k. F153, contract, collected contract reward ?k. Budget now 18.3k.
</p>

<p>
Now there are several fields cultivated which will get fertilizing and seeding contracts next, just need to wait or time accelerate a bit. Hmm if I even remember what keyboard hotkey is the time acceleration <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 1201hrs. Time accelerated to 02/mid-spring in-game 0739hrs and refreshed contracts, now several seeding ones appeared, they have okay-ish rewards but also require the seeds in the first place. Not sure if they are worth to take, I'll wait for fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
03/late-spring in-game 0700hrs, more seeding contracts appeared.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 0622hrs, no change.
</p>

<p>
02/mid-summer in-game 0700hrs, no change.
</p>

<p>
03/late-summer in-game 0702hrs, no change.
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 0739hrs, no change.
</p>

<p>
Hmm wonder if there are going to be any fertilizing contracts, AI seems to be very lazy to do any work by himself, seems like everything is on players shoulders. In a way that makes sense, whats the point if AI does all the work and players cannot have any fun, but I mean more about the fields being stuck in a stage, like now seeding. There has been no change in these field stages, they are waiting for AI or player to seed them, when I'm not doing it its on AI to do it, who doesn't seem to be interested.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about it more now, I should have done at least some small seeding contract just to keep things rolling forward.
</p>

<p>
At some point AI must do some work but, dunno it just looks like things are frozen here, AI is taking a siesta <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1918.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1918.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Looking at the contracts list there are all the same seeding contracts, then looking at field map... and heh, no fields seeded, none. Not sure what would happen if I took some seeding contract now which is NOT the planting season anymore... hmm. I better not, lets play it safe heh.
</p>

<p>
This would be a good thing to document though, why wonder about these things, test them, document them and everytime you return to FS19 after months long absence, you can just read your own <a href="guide.php">farming guide</a> and jump straight into the action.
</p>

<p>
Anyways for now, I'll continue time accelerating and watching what happens while also watching Farmhand mike's new (to me) youtube videos <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
02/mid-autumn in-game 0809hrs, no change.
</p>

<p>
03/late-autumn in-game 0907hrs, no change. Seems like this world is frozen in time...
</p>

<p>
01/early-winter in-game 0832hrs, no change. AI is slowly field by field doing cultivating contracts.
</p>

<p>
Did a quick browse through <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org/19/stories-from-zero-iowa-garden-city-unofficial.php">2021-02-18 Stories PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Unofficial Start From Zero</a> and it shows first fertilizing contract early-summer, so guess this time I missed all that, no fertilizing contracts this year and now its winter already. Interesting.
</p>

<p>
02/mid-winter in-game 0839hrs, weather -10C/-9C, no change.
</p>

<p>
Alright I wont write these play-by-plays as nothing is happening, I'll time accelerate until the first fertilizing contract appears. Just a recap, time acceleration is 6000 speed and I stop at morning daylight as can be seen from the in-game times. I never time accelerate more than one day, or like skipping a night. Sometimes I do additional time acceleration from morning to afternoon 1500hrs but seems that this gaming session there is usually no changes in afternoon time so I'll just blast right to the next morning.
</p>

<p>
02/mid-spring in-game 0745hrs, weather +4C/+5C, no change. Actually now I cleared all contracts, then refreshed them again, but still no fertilizing contracts. I want to play so decided to take one of the seeding contracts to smallest nearby field, should be doable with my 18.3k budget.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T19:48:09Z Accepted contract for seeding F147, purchased 2.1k liters of seeds for 1.8k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T19:50:44Z Started seeding F147, contract, manually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1957.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T1957.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Seems like 2.1k liters of seeds is enough for this field, was really relaxing to do some seeding for a change as earlier yesterday and today in fs22 all I did was herbicide spraying.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:13:09Z Finished seeding F147, contract, collected contract reward 7.3k.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after seeding was finished first fertilizing contract appeared. Okay so this time around you need to do those seeding contracts to get ball rolling, gotcha.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 23.8k and two pallets of seeds.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the fertilizing contract offered slurry spreader, so could not take it.
</p>

<p>
Browsed through the seeding contracts and found couple of big equipment borrowing ones, just hoping they wont eat too much seeds heh. Decided to take one closest to the dealership, to a field I already worked.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:26:20Z Accepted contract for seeding F148
</p>

<p>
First loaded the remaining seeds I had, then purchased two 2.1k liter seed pallets for 3.7k.
</p>

<p>
? Started seeding F148, contract, manually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T2033.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T2033.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:44:04Z Finished seeding F148, contract. Did not collect contract reward yet, want to check if there are other close by seeding contracts.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:45:46Z Accepted contract for seeding F151
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:46:34Z Started seeding F151, contract, manually.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T20:55:00Z Needed to take a lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T21:27:35Z Finished lunch break. Hmm my internet is down, cant continue watching Farmhand mike's videos <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well FS19 doesn't require internet, lets keep seeding soybeans.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T2139.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-25T2139.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-25T21:42:13Z Finished seeding F151, contract, collected contract reward 15.9k. Budget now 36k, slowly getting there, some seed money at least heh.
</p>

<p>
I want to take another seeding contract on the nearby fields especially as soybeans seeds are expended this slowly, I still got 1.3k liters left in the seeders tank.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T21:44:30Z Accepted contract for seeding F154 and purchased two 2.1k liters seed pallets for 3.7k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T21:47:57Z Started seeding F154, contract, manually.
</p>

<p>
Decided to return these borrowed vehicles. F148, contract, collected contract reward 11k and therefore returned the borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Now all these seeded fields have fertilizing contracts, one offers rubicon 9000 as borrowed vehicle, cool.
</p>

<p>
Also I am dead tired, my eyes are sore for looking at computer screens all day, but cant go to sleep yet.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T22:41:04Z Accepted contract for fertilizing F148, with borrowed rubicon 9000. Then accepted... well rest of the fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
Purchased eight 2k liter fertilizer tanks for 12.8k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T22:46:03Z Started fertilizing F148, contract.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-04-25T23:04:52Z Finished fertilizing F153, contract, collected contract reward 20.3k.
</p>

<p>
Gotta love rolling down the field in Rubicon 9000 ... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T23:05:48Z Started fertilizing F154, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T23:09:55Z Finished fertilizing F154, contract, collected contract reward 15.3k.
</p>

<p>
Then just drove sprayer to the dealership, unloaded remaining fertilizer which was quiet a lot, something like 4k liters, surprising seeing that but then again I've just used months of piece of crap fs22 without variable spray rate mod so heh.
</p>

<p>
F148, contract, collected contract reward 10.5k and returned borrowed rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 137.4k oh wow nice broke one hundred grand <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I could cheat and look at my other story, at which point there did I buy my own tractor and fertilizer/lime spreader, hmm.
</p>

<p>
There was one seeding contract for F215 which was ways towards SE and offered seed hawk for borrowed vehicles, that was tempting but nah, I'll time accelerate and see what we get next, interesting to see if AI does any contracts and will it open more fertilizing contracts. I wont write in play-by-play of time accelerating, just the interesting events.
</p>

<p>
03/late-spring in-game 1529hrs, weather +26C/+14C, AI seeded F253, nicely done AI <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
02/mid-summer in-game 0655hrs, weather +16C/+19C, new set of fertilizing contracts for the fields I seeded, around dealership (not for the F253 AI did). One contract offers rubicon 9000, rest are manure or slurry equipment.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T23:30:44Z Accepted contract for fertilizing F154 with borrowed rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-25T23:33:04Z Started fertilizing F147, contract.

<p>
Wanted to time accelerate and see what happens next, maybe spraying or harvest contract, those would be nice.
</p>

<p>
03/late-summer in-game 0648hrs, weather +15C/+18C, fertilizing contracts appeared on the fields I seeded. However no rubicon this time, going to borrow bredal solid fertilizer spreader in F153 contract.
