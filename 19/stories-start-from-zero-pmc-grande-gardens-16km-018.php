	<h2>2019-10-29 Breaking Magical 10 Million Money Limit</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-10-29T1056</b> FS19 started up, lets continue harvesting.
</p>

<p>
Moved coolamon mother bin into position east of F34. Recorded new grain truck courseplay course. Unloaded all combines from corn, sent grain truck with the last remaining corn to dump into farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
Corn harvest was 2.179m liters, quite nice haul, will take a while to sell that as well unless I'll get that train track sell point added heh.
</p>

<p>
Refueled all the vehicles again, got to love large scale farming logistics <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 1956hrs night is quickly falling, I'm not going to harvest in a night so its time acceleration to skip the night.
</p>

<p>
1154 Started harvesting sunflowers F34, courseplay ETA 1h 24min, 4x tools<br>
1342 Finished harvesting sunflowers F34
</p>

<p>
That's it all the harvest have been completed for this season (unless double cropping that is).
</p>

<p>
Sunflowers harvest got me 647.4k liters of grain.
</p>

<p>
Felt great accomplishment by preparing and harvesting all these existing fields when looking at the huge amount of grain in our farm bin silo plus in the railroad silo 3. But at the same time while I was not bored or exhausted... I did feel a bit overwhelmed to start all of this over again because I'm either going to time accelerate for better market prices and sell grain or start the field work loop all over again.
</p>

<p>
It was funny that I was just sitting there looking at the mapview wondering what should I do next heh, obviously I need to do something because just watching gets me nowhere (fast heh) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its not that I don't want to farm, I do, but the amount of work in real life 16hrs DAYS is a lot if I would now start to prepare the fields for the next planting season.
</p>

<p>
I would like to sell the grain to get millions of money so I could buy more land and possibly even upgrade some vehicles for example plowing two times 55ha with only one 15m plow doesn't sound very appealing to me, also only one seed hawk setup is not enough for these existing fields. But for selling the grain I need to buy at least another truck and more likely edit PMC Grange Gardens 16km terrain itself to include train track sell point so I can capture that amazing feeling of truly large scale farming logistics grain sell events like in FS17 Cornbelt using the train.
</p>

<p>
1438 Decided to take a little break, not from PMC Gaming but just to check out some other FS19 terrain stuff while I let the idea what to do next marinate a bit.
</p>

<p>
Was looking into adding train selling points but because of seasons savegame... its not going to be easy without creating a new savegame and I really don't want to do that right now. So I decided to just keep continue playing like this, time accelerating not doing any double cropping. Lets see how the crop sell prices change and which selling point they lead to. If its something silly like other side of the terrain... then dunno maybe I could do that train edit hehe
</p>

<p>
1655 Back in PMC Grande Gardens 16km, time acceleration continues...
</p>

<p>
23/late-autumn in-game 0801hrs canola market price is 2287 on selling point 10, its time to sell some grain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First I need to upgrade my equipment, going to buy another semi-tipper 70k liter trailer, this time with dolly and <i>another</i> trailer which gives me 140k combined carrying capacity in single load. Thats pretty nice for a semi truck.
</p>

<pre>
- 2x trailer semi-tipper 70000/6 69k
- trailer semi-tipper 70000/6 with oversize load option 69.1k
- 2x dolly 10l 9k
</pre>
<p>
1820 Purchased above list, budget now 415k
</p>

<p>
Budget sidenote, I get charged vehicle running costs about 1k - 1.5k every night, I don't know why. It started when I purchased the claas lexion 8900s and I suspect there was some bug with the leased telehandler and combine, I returned those, my leased menu is empty yet I get charge for fees.
</p>

<p>
1842 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.1k + 160.1k<br>
1859 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.1k + 160.1k
</p>

<p>
Went and picked up the other semi-tipper 70k trailer with dolly from the shop using my other semi truck. Next I'm going to transfer all the canola from railroad silo 3 to farm bin silo. Yes tedious, I will get around to add the train connections and selling points one day heh.
</p>

<p>
1918 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.1k + 160.1k
</p>

<p>
When I had two semi trucks using 140k trailer capacity hauling grain from railroad silo 3 to farm bin silo... I felt like come on man, ANYTHING would be faster than this, I should have just gone and edited the terrain to add train depot connectivity with selling points, but no... I wanted to continue this same save to maintain the seasons save stuff hehe.
</p>

<p>
Oh well I'm definitely doing those edits ASAP and the next game-play harvest wise will be on the new terrain edits with proper train connectivity.
</p>

<p>
2046 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>
2048 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>

2140 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>
2142 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>
2157 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>
2159 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.2k + 160.2k<br>
2215 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.3k + 160.3k<br>
2217 Sold canola in selling point 10 for 160.3k + 160.3k
</p>

<p>
Canola market prices were increasing in selling point 6 so once they hit 2321 and stabilized there, I switched courseplay course to that location. Had to record a new course. Because of the train system being incomplete I drove my trucks unrealistically straight line across AI owned fields etc.
</p>

<p>
I was even considering cheating by looking at the market prices and how many liters I have grain, then edit savegame and just replace the grain with equal amount of money completely skipping the trucking... but that was just a quick thought nothing serious, if you are lazy enough not to edit the terrain for train selling points then shut the hell up and drive the trucks! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But yeah it all comes down to the crazy time sink that farmsim is, I really do not need my own terrain editing decisions (laziness) to cause any extra time wasted with this game heh. Anyways.

This latest sell broke 10 million money limit, very cool. I told ya the harvest of all those fields will produce so much money I will be rolling in it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

And with that sell it was time for me to call it a night, dead tired yawning like crazy here. More farming tomorrow, maybe some land purchases <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
