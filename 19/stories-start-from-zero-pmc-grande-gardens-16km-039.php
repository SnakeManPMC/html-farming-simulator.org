	<h2>2019-11-23 Buying All The Farmland Historical Moment</h2>

<p>
0952 New farming day has started, FS19 booted up, what are we going to do today?
</p>

<p>
Transferred some fertilizer to liquid fertilizer factory. Manure to fertilizer factory.
</p>

<p>
Then it was just time accelerating to get into the soybean/corn selling days, also monitoring closely for any random high demands, you never know when you might get lucky like we did previously with the corn 1659 sell.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-spring soil temperature hit +6C and forecast shows no temperatures less anymore so we would be able to seed canola.
</p>

<p>
I was not interested in field work, just to get my grain sold when the right market price selling day comes along, it kind of felt like a shame to just time accelerate these perfectly good field working days heh. But not to worry, there is plenty of field work to be done lateron <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
18/late-spring soil temperature now +10C so could plant corn and soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerating with seasons takes a really long time because "synchronizing after the fast-forward" dialog sometimes lasts more than minute, I always ALT-TAB because its waste of time to stare at static waiting screen. As most times I have been watching real life farming youtube videos that got queued up during the few days I edited this terrain. A lot of minutes to watch and some good farming action as its harvest season in real life.
</p>

<p>
07/early-summer in-game 0646hrs, corn 1498 and soybeans 3689 prices. We are getting close to the high selling day which should be... well actually tomorrow, hmm well that snuck up to me rather quick while watching youtube farming videos. Got to be ready to start hauling some grain in-game tomorrow if not today.
</p>

<p>
In-game 1008hrs corn is 1502 in selling point 6 which has railroad access.
</p>

<p>
08/early-summer okay seasons highest corn and soybeans selling day has arrived, in-game 0014hrs corn 1520 in selling point 3 (truck) and soybeans 3734 in selling point 11 (train).
</p>

<p>
Now comes the risky part, do I start to sell right now as the price is very nice, or do I wait for the highest peak of today for example at least to the 0600hrs or so in the morning daylight because I hate to work in the darkness. Hmm hmm, last time when I was fishing for the highest price it was missed, lets see what happens today I'll continue time accelerating in one hour increments into morning daylight and then we start to sell grain in massive scale.
</p>

<p>
In-game 0500hrs corn 1536 in selling point 5 (truck), soybeans 3744 in selling point 11 (train).
</p>

<p>
Then time accelerated just enough for the daylight to break so I can work properly, in-game 0551hrs and prices are the same as above. Lets get to work, first we begin with corn to haul it to railroad silo 11 which is by SW train. Man that will take a while <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I had to save and exit the game, then open items.xml to find out WHERE are my corn and soybeans stored at.
</p>

<p>
1243 Started to haul 3.208m corn from farm bin silo 1 to railroad silo 3<br>
1311 Started loading NW train with 2.672m liters of soybeans from railroad silo 4
</p>

<p>
While the train was loading deadly slowly I went and edited the train grain bin silo emptying speed to 15k liters per second. Will savegame and restart after the train is full.
</p>

<p>
1329 Finished loading NW train<br>
1334 Saved game and exited to upgrade PMC Grande Gardens 16km terrain for experimental train loading speed fix<br>
1340 Upgraded and FS19 booted up, lets see how our trains work now<br>
1341 Started unloading NW train soybeans to railroad silo 1<br>
1347 Finished unloading NW train
</p>

<p>
That 15k liters per second unloading speed felt pretty balanced, it was very game-play oriented that I had no time to ALT-TAB when unloading the train which is the whole point, if stuff takes so long that you are yawning and watching youtube videos on the background... what the hell is the point of playing anymore?
</p>

<p>
And it didn't feel like "TOP DOWN BOYZ" 100km/h combine with 1000m header kiddie crap either.
</p>

<p>
But boy does the truck hauling of corn take forever, uuh... yes I only have a one truck doing it with courseplay now because additional trucks collide with the truck in front of them causing real mayhem, if you want hands free courseplay operation it has to be with one truck. And the unloading takes forever as I have to use "grain door" unloading mode because trailer is tipping and the train grain bin silo building is so low that it would collide with the trailer. I could do this faster by babysitting three trucks, but right now I'm handling the soybean train hauling operation.
</p>

<p>
1356 Loaded NE train with very low amount of barley and sunflowers (hey it was on my way there)<br>
1401 Started loading NE train with soybeans on railroad silo 1<br>
1409 Finished loading NE train, total of 2.860m liters of soybeans<br>
1416 NE train full of soybeans arrived to selling point 11, budget now 9.907m and starting to sell my very first soybeans 20 car train load <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy"><br>
1417 Sold 143k liters of soybeans to selling point 11 for 536k TIMES TWENTY! MUHAHAHAHAA!
</p>

<p>
Budget now 20.628m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1430 Lunch break...<br>
1525 Food cooked and eaten, lets get back to selling some grain<br>
1526 Started loading NE train with soybeans on railroad silo 1, total of 2.512m liters<br>
1533 Finished loading NE train<br>
1539 Sold 143k liters of soybeans to selling point 11 for 536k times 17, then one car for 306.9k
</p>
 
<p>
Budget now 30.048m !
</p>

<p>
Noticed that soybean market price in selling point 8 is 3728 (selling point 11 the highest now is 3749) so decided to sell from farm bin silo 1 directly using truck to selling point 8.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Budget now 50.380m haha <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I mean seriously, fifty million in cash! That is some serious coin gentlemen <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Continued corn haul from farm bin silo 1 to railroad silo 3 but on the first load silo ran out of corn already, well good.
</p>

<p>
1807 Saved game, backupped savegames and restarted FS19, just felt like so much work is done that I want to have backups etc.
</p>

<p>
Currently grain stocks are soybeans 1.894m liters and corn 751.6k in farm bin silo(s) and 3.208m liters in railroad silo(s). Market for corn is 1541 in selling point 5 (truck) and soybeans 3747 in selling point 10 (truck).
</p>

<p>
Now that I have this massive wealth of fifty million, I'm going to start buying the remaining land lots in this terrain and I'm hoping the fiddy is enough to purchase them all.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Budget now 10.113m and I purchased all the fields except the crown jewel, the big monster F40 hehe.
</p>

<p>
I walked (fast 20 times walking speed) around my new lands, they are simply massive. Right now even though I still have the goal to purchase the F40 and harvest all the fields, those feel so distant far away in the horizon that I don't even think of them now. I just don't have the motivation to play so unbelievable amount of hours again to harvest all these fields.
</p>

<p>
For example cultivating 500ha field takes just forever, I am not sure I want to do such tasks in one sitting. Honestly thinking about it now even lets say spread across many days over a week or even longer playing few hours every now and then... feels stupid, who would want to start FS19, sit in a tractor cultivating a field for 1h 45min and then save game, exit and be done playing for the day, huh? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Overall I feel like I've reached the point that I've wasted enough time with farmsim, meaning nothing has changed I still love to FS19 farm but I don't want to waste WEEKS straight doing it.
</p>

<p>
I'm sad if I don't play, but if I waste 2-3 months just doing one round of field work on one terrain... sounds pretty damn crazy to me. (OK I don't know how long would it take but in general idea).
</p>

<p>
Anyways, deep thoughts man.
</p>

<p>
1847 I was so undecisive about what to do next so I saved the game and exited, going to make latest inventory of my grain for starters but also not waste any precious highest selling day of the season time just for wondering what to do next.
</p>

<p>
Pulled the grain inventory from items.xml and looks like there is million liters of soybeans and a bit corn in the farm NE, so yeah I'm going to go sell those.
</p>

<p>
1855 Okay FS19 fired back up, lets continue selling grain.
</p>

<p>
Hah just realized that the highest market price for soybeans is right next to the farm bin silo where my soybeans are stored <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1908 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 262.4k + 262.4k<br>
1916 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 262.4k + 262.4k<br>
1918 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 262.4k + 262.4k
</p>

<p>
At this point had to go run quick test in modo so missed few soybean sells heh.
</p>

<p>
1928 Back at PMC Gaming, hands on keyboard, grain trucks still rolling <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1931 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 262.4k + 262.4k<br>
1932 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 262.4k + 262.4k
</p>

<p>
Then on the next unload ran out of soybeans in the farm bin silo NE, hmm oh right there is bunch of them in bin by the F19. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
1937 Sold soybeans in selling point 10 for 220.7k
</p>

<p>
Okay this farm bin silo NE is now empty of soybeans. Budget now 14.003m hey I can buy the last F40 heh.
</p>

<p>
1940 Purchased land lot with F40 in it for 12.054m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.949m just barely some buffer money heh.
</p>

<p>
This is kind of historical moment that I managed to buy all the land lots (with fields on them) in PMC Grange Gardens 16km terrain which is quite achievement with Start From Zero career. Of course the final goal is to harvest all the fields... but as I said above, that is for... well probably for next year <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Actually I'm going to shut down FS19 now, its just what could I achieve today anymore that would give any meaning other than boredom and exhausting feeling, so better to call it quits here and who knows tomorrow or when we return <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1944 Time to call it a day, was some good fun today for sure.
</p>
