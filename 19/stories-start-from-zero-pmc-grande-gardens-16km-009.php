2020 Back at PMC Gaming, hey what else am I gonna do, lets continuing growing our farm.<br>
2022 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k<br>
2038 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k<br>
2059 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k<br>
2115 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k<br>
2131 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k<br>
2140 Finished lime spreading F38<br>
2147 Sold soybeans in selling point 1 for 181.6k, budget now 3.380m<br>
2151 Started fertilizing F38<br>
2156 Started seeding canola F39<br>
2202 Soybeans market price in selling point 8 is now the highest, 3078 vs 3094 and increasing, so I switched my transport grain route accordingly.<br>
</p>

<p>
I sold a lot of soybeans before selling point 8 price started to increase, at the time of writing this its already 3138 which is really good (my high score record is 3304). Hopefully the price increases to record high again, still have about two hundred thousand liters to sell.
</p>

<p>
2251 Finished fertilizing F38
</p>

<p>
I made a list of growing or harvest ready soybean fields: 15, 30, 31, 41, 48, 72 and 79. I can basically rule out 72 and 79 as they are other side of the terrain, way too long distance to relocate my harvesting fleet. 30 is monster size and I don't have money for it. Rest... well 15 is nice, relatively big and pretty close, 48 is also big but at the east side of the terrain. So all in all, I would most probably buy F15.
</p>

<p>
For canola; 27, 11, 21, 55 and 81. Lets rule out 81 straight off the bat as its almost the other side of the terrain, 55 unfortunaely is on a bad farmland ID painting land lot which costs huge 10.9m (my bad, will be fixed in the future). That leaves us with a big 21 as the two others are pretty small.
</p>

<p>
We can't forget that this is very short sighted thing, choosing a land to purchase only of what its growing is only worth for one harvest, so its not very smart to purchase land lot in the other side of the terrain if you only benefit for it one time, you probably waste more money on fuel costs driving your vehicles back and forth there not to mention the wasted time in the long run heh.
</p>

<p>
Hmm but I'm lazy, I just want to get farming... so I'm thinking of buying land next to my farm as there is this nice group of land/fields which would only cost total of 2.4m so I even had a bit buffer money left. Hmm. Except... here are sunflowers and corn fields then all rest of them are crap potatoes, ugh. That would mean a lot of plowing stuff under.
