<p>
Mods Game-play for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. These are mods that do not add any vehicles or implements but simply modify how farmsim game runs or behaves. It could be as simple as removing crosshairs, adding real time clock or as complex as guidanceSteering (GPS) or other automated tools. Overall game-play mods are transparent which enhance farming gaming experience by adding, tweaking or removing some features.

v by . From modDesc:

<p>
FS19_AutoDrive.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: This game-play improvement mod can be used to create waypoints to a network of routes for vehicles to drive autonomously. Once setup you can tell a tractor which is anywhere close to the network to drive to any point, such as the shop, field 1 or to a sell point.
</p>

<p>
AutoDrive waypoints need to be recorded on both sides of the road to avoid collisions. Open / close GUI by the X in top-right corner or with ALT-keypad zero. You can move the GUI box by LMB dragging from the top header bar. Edit mode is the yield icon on GUI bottom right corner. Record a path is the usual REC icon. Record icon turns red is for one way and purple is two way paths. Toggle connection between icon connects paths together. Update path must be clicked to make the paths work. Select path: use the left/right "arrow" icons, start by hitting the commit icon (circle with line up at the top, ugh difficult to explain).

<p>
Notes: v1.1 update on 2019-04-08. Displays the vehicles of your own farm (driver, vehicle name, condition, capacity). Trailers and attachments are grouped with the respective tractor. Multiplayer: Normally only vehicles of the own farms are displayed, unless a player of the own farm controls a vehicle of another farm. The display can be switched with the key combination CTRL + NUM6 (normal, long, short). Further settings can be made in the file Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2019\modSettings\Inspector\Inspector.xml. This XML file can be reloaded without restarting the game with CTRL + NUM9.

	<h2>Manual Attach</h2>

<p>
v by Wopster. From modDesc:
</p>

<p>
FILENAME
</p>

<p>
Notes: This mod enforces you to attach/detach tools and trailers manually. 2019-08-08 big bud 747 + seedhawk did not work, I could not turn on the seeder, I guess it needs a PTO and manual attach enforces that?
</p>

<p>
Attach/Detach implements: When attaching an implement the script forces the implement to stay at it's lowered state. There are some exceptions made for frontloaders, skidsteers, shovels, telehandlers, combines and hooklift implements. You're still able to attach and detach those implements without having to leave your vehicle.
</p>

<p>
Note: The connection hoses and power take off still require to be attached manually for those implements. In order to detach, the implement needs to be lowered first! Also make sure that the power take off and connection hoses are detached before detaching the implement.
</p>

<p>
The mod disables attaching and detaching from inside the vehicle (exceptions are mentioned above). Like the mod title already suggests it’s not possible anymore to do the quick switches between implements.. get out that vehicle for real this time!
</p>

<p>
Attach/Detach power take off: Hit Z in order to attach/detach the power take off. Keep in mind that a tool needs a power take off, otherwise it can't be turned on! Attach/Detach connection hoses: Hold Z (for a short amount of time) in order to attach/detach the connection hoses.
</p>

<p>
Without attached connection hoses the following can occur: You won't be able to control hydraulics (e.g. moving parts, folding, use ridge markers etc). You won't be able to use the lights. Brakes will be blocked.

<p>
v by . From modDesc:

<p>
FS19_parkVehicle.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: You can (de)activate the tabbing of the current vehicle with CTRL-T. In Multiplayer the parking state is only set for yourself. The state is saved in single player and in multiplayer. Works great, if you do not want to use vehicle explorer or wait until Decker releases his vehicle group switcher (2021-06-11 looks like Decker is not about to port his vehicle group switcher to FS19), this is a must mod.

	<h2>TimeScale</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by LTW. From modDesc:
</p>

<p>
FS19_timeScale.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: This script extends the time scale up to a maximum of "9000". The additional values can be switched by pressing "lctrl + KP_plus" and "lctrl + KP_minus". Press the key "7" or "8" to reset the time scale to "1" or "120". The time scale can only be changed by an admin.
</p>

<p>
Works OK, hit CTRL-+ (control and keypad plus) enough times for the crazy 9000 speed time acceleration, then just 7 once to return into real time. Without seasons field growth stage goes to "sleep" if you time accelerate faster than 120 (dunno how much, 300 already is too much), so in my opinion it is not wise to use mods for time acceleration without seasons, and just use 120 in-game one. With seasons its safe to use 6000 speed time acceleration when skipping days.

<h2>DashTime</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Haverdaden. From ModDesc: Farming Simulator 19 - DashTime
</p>

<p>
Does not work, its default key binded to 0 which is vehicle honk, it kicks in 1200x time acceleration and bugs often that it gets stuck and it fast forwards like a day even though you are not pressing 0 button at all. Avoid this mod.

<h2>RealClock Mod</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Grisu118 - Vertexdezign, Slivicon. From modDesc: Shows the current real time in the upper right corner.

</p>
<ul>
<li>Position</li>
<li>Color and size of text</li>
<li>Format of datetime string (placeholders see formats_en.txt)</li>
</ul>

<p>
2019-02-21 tested and works OK. Works as advertized, shows your local computer time on top right corner of the screen. Writes realClock.xml file into mods directory, not in the modsSettings like it should.

<h2>FastNight</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by apuehri. From modDesc: The night will pass faster than you think! This mod sets the time scale once in the morning and once in the evening on a certain time scale! "Left-Shift" + "0" calls up the settings menu in which the values can be changed. Settings are saved in the savegame. In addition, the keys "Left-Shift" + "7" / "Left-Shift" + "8" can be used to manually change the time scale in finer steps! Buttons only works outside of vehicles!
</p>

<p>
For those who want automatic night time accelleration this is excellent mod. You can setup time when night starts, how much time accelleration to use from 1x to 300x, then setup when day time starts and same settings there. Works very well.

<h2>Manual Attaching</h2>

<p>
Keyboard shortcuts:<br>
Q attach / detach implement<br>
X attach / detach PTO<br>
SHIFT-A mode(?)<br>
CTRL-A help menu
</p>

<p>
2019-02-21 tested and works OK. Manual attaching is great, gives you more personal intimate feeling to the implements as its just not hit Q and everything is done. Note: on my previous tests it did give error in the log, but today it did not, go figure. Maybe its some specific mod conflict I dont know, will have to track it down. <i>Edit 2024-12-15T21:23:09Z, wait, isn't this a dupe of Wopsters Manual Attach mod? Hmm.</i>

<h2>Vehicle Explorer</h2>

<p>
v0.9.0.6 by sperrgebiet. From modDesc: This is a revamp of the good old VehicleSort from FS17. For beginners: VehicleExplorer helps you organize your vehicles, by showing you a list which can be organized, well, sorted by you. Besides that it has a couple of additional functionality. See below.

FS19_Variable_Spray_Usage.zip

<p>
Notes: This script makes it possible to calculate the application rate of liquidmanure, manure, fertilizer, lime, liquid fertilizer and herbicide to the worked hectare. The application rate is regulated depending on the speed. This means, no matter what speed is applied, the application rate is always adjusted. The script installs itself in all vehicles that have the specialization "sprayer", so in all Slurry spreading devices, syringes, fertilizer spreaders and manure spreaders. The following application rates are possible: Liquid fertilizer / herbicide 100 to 800 liters / hectare. Fertilizer / lime 100 to 9000 liters / hectare. Solid manure 12,000 to 30,000 liters / hectare or 12 to 30 m³ / hectare. Manure 10000 to 45000 liters / hectare or 10 to 45 m³ / hectare.
