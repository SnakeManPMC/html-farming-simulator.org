<p>
FS19_AutoDrive.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: This mod can be used to create a network of routes for vehicles to drive autonomously. Once setup you can tell a tractor which is standing anywhere close to the network to drive to any point, such as the shop, field 1 or to a sell point. not good as big bud 450 or even lizard hulk truck will overshoot a corner turn and just start to cicle endlessly like dog chasing its own tail... forget this unusable mod.
</p>

<p>
AutoDrive does not avoid obstacles, it needs a clear path to the next waypoint. Paths need to be recorded on both sides of the road to avoid collisions. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to handle 90 degree corners (intersections basically) very well, lizard hulk truck with trempe trailer misses the corner and starts to loop around like dog chasing its own tail, kind of what happened to big bud 450 which I first thought was articulated tractor issue. Open / close GUI by the X in top-right corner or with ALT-keypad zero. You can move the GUI box by LMB dragging from the top header bar. Edit mode is the yield icon on GUI bottom right corner. Record a path is the usual REC icon. Record icon turns red is for one way and purple is two way paths. Toggle connection between icon connects paths together. Update path must be clicked to make the paths work. Select path: use the left/right "arrow" icons, start by hitting the commit icon (circle with line up at the top, ugh difficult to explain).

FS19_Inspector.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: v1.1 update on 2019-04-08. Displays the vehicles of your own farm (driver, vehicle name, condition, capacity). Trailers and attachments are grouped with the respective tractor. Multiplayer: Normally only vehicles of the own farms are displayed, unless a player of the own farm controls a vehicle of another farm. The display can be switched with the key combination CTRL + NUM6 (normal, long, short). Further settings can be made in the file Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2019\modSettings\Inspector\Inspector.xml. This XML file can be reloaded without restarting the game with CTRL + NUM9.

	<h2>Manual Attach</h2>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Notes: This mod enforces you to attach/detach tools and trailers manually. 2019-08-08 big bud 747 + seedhawk did not work, I could not turn on the seeder, I guess it needs a PTO and manual attach enforces that?
</p>

<p>
Attach/Detach implements: When attaching an implement the script forces the implement to stay at it's lowered state. There are some exceptions made for frontloaders, skidsteers, shovels, telehandlers, combines and hooklift implements. You're still able to attach and detach those implements without having to leave your vehicle.
</p>

<p>
Note: The connection hoses and power take off still require to be attached manually for those implements. In order to detach, the implement needs to be lowered first! Also make sure that the power take off and connection hoses are detached before detaching the implement.
</p>

<p>
The mod disables attaching and detaching from inside the vehicle (exceptions are mentioned above). Like the mod title already suggests itâ€™s not possible anymore to do the quick switches between implements.. get out that vehicle for real this time!
</p>

<p>
Attach/Detach power take off: Hit Z in order to attach/detach the power take off. Keep in mind that a tool needs a power take off, otherwise it can't be turned on! Attach/Detach connection hoses: Hold Z (for a short amount of time) in order to attach/detach the connection hoses.
</p>

<p>
Without attached connection hoses the following can occur: You won't be able to control hydraulics (e.g. moving parts, folding, use ridge markers etc). You won't be able to use the lights. Brakes will be blocked.

</p>

<p>
Notes: You can (de)activate the tabbing of the current vehicle with CTRL-T. In Multiplayer the parking state is only set for yourself. The state is saved in single player and in multiplayer. Works great, if you do not want to use vehicle explorer or wait until Decker releases his vehicle group switcher (2021-06-11 looks like Decker is not about to port his vehicle group switcher to FS19), this is a must mod.
