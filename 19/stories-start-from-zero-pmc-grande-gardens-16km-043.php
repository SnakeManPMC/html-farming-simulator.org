	<h2>2019-11-28 Quick Farming Day</h2>

<p>
2235 New farming day has started, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
09/mid-summer in-game 2100hrs, night is falling so have to time accelerate until morning daylight before starting this seeding.
</p>

<p>
2312 Started seeding soybeans F03, courseplay ETA 55min, 4x tools<br>
<b>2019-11-29T012</b> Finished seeding soybeans F03
</p>

<p>
Just when I was about to start fertilizing F05 I noticed it was growing weeds... how is that possible as I JUST blanket herbicide sprayed it? What kind of bullshit is this that you spend better part of three hours spraying a field and few in-game days later that fucking thing is again growing weeds?
</p>

<p>
Seasons bug, no other explanation, hell I even re-read this story that did I not spray it, yes indeed I did spray the field and yeah... this sucks. Whats the point of playing 20FPS performance buggy piece of shit?
</p>

<p>
Well I decided to start fertilizing this field as I was using VLC player to watch a movie in the background, but my motivation for FS19 playing was all time low right now...
</p>

<p>
0017 Started fertilizing F05, courseplay ETA 2h 47min, 4x tools<br>
0320 Finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
Funny thing that my movie ended just as rubicons finished this very long fertilization field work. As said I was really bummed out by the growing weeds and the oncoing awful 20FPS performance that I stopped playing for tonight here. Right now I don't feel like playing but give it one or two hard editing days and I'm sure I get drawn back here, I just don't know how I can ignore the F05 buggy weed situation...
</p>

<p>
0324 Shut down FS19.
