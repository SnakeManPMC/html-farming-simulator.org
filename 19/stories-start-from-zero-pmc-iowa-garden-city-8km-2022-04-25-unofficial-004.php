	<h2>2022-04-28 Purchasing Rubicon 9000 Sprayer</h2>

<p>
2022-04-28T14:15:18Z New farming day has started, this saveame now has 27hrs 54min on it.
</p>

<p>
When I loaded into game there was immediate notification that some contract completed, hum I don't have my yesterdays story open here but from "fresh" memory I recall saving game and exiting after I completed current contract, hmm so could this be the known fs19 bug again where saving game and restarting will magically finish some spraying (fert or herb) contracts?
</p>

<p>
Hmm, well I mean... I didn't cheat, game says contract is complete, who am I to argue with FS19 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Collected F246 contract reward 47.8k and F247 reward 21.3k. Still got F248 contract open which I'm going to do next.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed contracts and just massive amount of fertilizing contracts available now, wow... its going to be a busy day ...
</p>

<p>
<img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Let's get to work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T14:26:32Z Started fertilizing F248, contract, GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T14:41:47Z Finished fertilizing F248, contract, collected reward 30.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T14:44:29Z Accepted fertilizing contract F206, for 110.3k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T14:45:33Z Started fertilizing F206, contract, GPS.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to do as many of these fertilizing contracts as my patience allows, there are just pages and pages worth of them, is like contract nerds paradize <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to take them one at the time, picking the closest one of my location. Easy way would be to just take them all and use mapview to go to the nearest blinking field ID, but often times that leads to the <i>"you have no access to this land"</i> contract bug, so lets see how many can I do one by one.
</p>

<p>
The thought crossed my mind to go and buy rubicon and rock it with courseplay, but dunno, I'd like to just chill for now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'm using cab view and just enjoying the ride in grass roots level, no stupid 3rd person zoomed out distant view.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T15:39:56Z Finished fertilizing F206, contract, collected reward 110.3k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T15:43:07Z Accepted fertilizing contract F203, for 109.9k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T15:44:31Z Started fertilizing F203, contract.
</p>

<p>
With this contract there is going to be refill. Thinking a bit about buying rubicon and starting to work with courseplay <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T16:03:21Z Had to take a short break ...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T16:25:08Z Back, lets spread.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-28T1638.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-28T1638.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-28T16:49:37Z Bredal K165 is empty, back to refill this beast.
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership, purchased ten 1k liter pallets of solid fertilizer for 19.2k times two, refilled bredal speader full.
</p>

<p>
Just realized how quickly things escalate, first you spend unbearable amount of driving hours manually, then when you finally get GPS... it feels like you do just handful of contracts until you start to look into the horizon and plan on buying more vehicles and start rocking with courseplay.
</p>

<p>
I like GPS, its very relaxing and nice to drive using it. Dunno why is it always so short time before you jump into courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Right now my budget is 631.7k and driving this single tractor pulling bredal k165 feels like too slow, I need to expand my vehicle fleet. Thinking about buying either medium small size tractor with bredal, or go for gold with rubicon 9000. Bredal setup would require less refilling but would be slower of course, bredals endurance with spread product is crazy, you can stay out spreading for hours. In comparison I recall rubicon 9000 empties quite fast, but who knows maybe my recollection is poisoned with the fs22 garbage which doesn't even have variable rate usage mod.
</p>

<p>
All in all, I'm ready for courseplay <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T17:15:38Z Finished fertilizing F203, contract, collected reward 109.9k. Budget now 741.6k.
</p>

<p>
Now its time for a lunch break, honestly depends how my mood is after the meal it might be I'll call it a night for FS19 after, wont be shutting the game down yet, on paper I would like to continue but this is a little bit grind now, I mean seven hundred grand in cash, nice tractor with bredal and horizon full of fertilizing contracts, whats the challenge heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T17:43:43Z Feeding time over.
</p>

<p>
Yeah farming continues <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'm going shopping!
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer 25km/h 48.5m 9000 liter hardi rubicon 9000 with guidance steering 504k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased big boy sprayer with GPS. Lets call this a bosses toy.
</p>

<p>
Purchased ten 2k liter liquid fertilizer tanks for 32k. Refilled rubicon up.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T17:49:20Z Accepted fertilizing contract F01, for 146k.
</p>

<p>
This F01 was a big contract, what I can see its the biggest fertilizing contract currently. Plan is to drive rubicon 9000 there and then setup new holland t8.320 with bredal k165 to some other field using courseplay while I'm driving rubicon with GPS for my own enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
This is like the good old times, courseplay running another vehicle when I'm driving with GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
My mind starts to go for semi-truck tanker trailer setup to feed rubicon with liquids heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-28T18:48:16Z Finished fertilizing F01, contract, collected reward 146k.

Feels so good to be able to collect contract rewards freely without worrying about collecting the one which got your leased vehicles from heh.
