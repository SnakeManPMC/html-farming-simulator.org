<p>
2145 Accepted contract for fertilizing F71<br>
2153 Started fertilizing F71, contract, courseplay ETA 1h 10min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Started to get a little bored, I now have money to buy small to medium size vehicle fleet for basic farming and when F71 contract is done I have well over one million in cash. What is there left for me to do anymore I wonder... hmm, yeah at this point all I can do is to start an actual farm to buy land and vehicles, or buy more rubicons which will speed up fertilizing contract work but also makes it more messy, more vehicles to haul around and unless the field is mega big using 4 rubicons might get busy.
</p>

<p>
2258 Finished fertilizing F71, contract, collected contract reward 444.3k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.250m goodness gracious... this after 20 or so hours game-play. Needless to say better contracts mod is awesome for Start From Zero <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove all vehicles to dealership and was pretty much ready to call it a night. But decided to time accelerate with the good old 6000 speed to see if more fertilizing contracts appear, I will not take them I'm all exhausted for playing.
</p>

<p>
2324 Called it a night, most likely for this whole savegame as well. Thanks for reading <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
