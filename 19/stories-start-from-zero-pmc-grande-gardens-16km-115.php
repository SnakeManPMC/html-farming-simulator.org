	<h2>2021-05-31 Finished Harvesting Corn F56</h2>

<p>

</p>

2225 So tired cant keep my eyes open, have to take a nap<br>
<b>2021-06-01T0116</b> Nap time over, back to farming
</p>

<p>
I'm going to edit current captured videos before starting FS19 back up because Gaming computer cant really run video editing and FS19 at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Oh and month changed to june as well <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0155 Video edited and verified, FS19 started back up, corn harvest continues
</p>

<p>
0315 Lunch break...<br>
0407 Done eating, back to corn harvesting
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0446.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0446.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
I left FS19 running with stopped vehicles when going to cook food and eat it, now that I came back... its 11/mid-autumn in-game 1900hrs, weather +13/+15C ... raining <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Uh oh raining, oh right this is the rain that was forecasted... or was it, hmm this seems like sudden random rain shower as the forecasted rain is now for tomorrow in-game 1200hrs all the way to midnight (weather menu slot after 2100hrs which is empty, ie midnight).
</p>

<p>
Looking at drying potential indicator it looks like tomorrow morning 0600hrs and 0900hrs its + but then again at 1200hrs the new rain starts. Interesting to see of nightly ground moisture dissipates and we get to harvest before new big rain front arrives.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated through the rain and night. 12/mid-autumn in-game 0856hrs, weather +10C/+15C, no rain, forecast now shows rain from 1200hrs to 2100hrs (midnight no rain). Lets continue harvesting as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
So continued harvesting by first driving grain cart tractor to unload combines, then started off lead combine... and I kidd you not, it got like 20 meters done when it started to rain in-game 0903hrs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Forecast now shows 0900hrs to 2100hrs raining oh maan <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated through the night, it stopped raining and one point then continued againg before ending before morning daylight. 13/mid-autumn in-game 0830hrs, weather +8C/+14C, no raing (soil is wet though). Forecast now shows clear skies for couple of days, plenty of time to finish F56 corn harvest, alright we are good to go.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated slowly at 600 speed waiting for ground soil to dry up for harvest condition... however it didn't happen before night fell at in-game 1933hrs. When I hit key 7 to reset time scale to real time THEN soil moisture icon disappeared <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
13/mid-autumn in-game 1934hrs, weather +18C/+14c forecast clear skies. But its dark, need to time accelerate until morning daylight. 14/mid-autumn in-game 0800hrs, weather +9C/+14C, soil is dry, lets harvest some corn! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
0555 First combine low on fuel, its refueling time<br>
0606 All vehicles refueled, back on harvesting corn<br>
0922 Finished harvesting corn F56
</p>

<p>
Harvest season is done! Hooyah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0922.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0922.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
Great feeling to have this done because now I'm free of this savegames pressure that "need to get season finished". Now I can again concentrate on editing PMC Grande Gardens 16km without any consideration for savegame porting like field work being undone etc. Just awesome refreshing freeing feeling, cant wait to start add some new edits soon.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0938.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0938.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
Then I moved harvest fleet to F56 SE corner and parked them there into the field. Took a screenshot too of course heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0943.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-06-01T0943.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
Went through all other vehicles and parked few of them into fields so next upgrade goes without vehicles colliding into possible newly added objects.
</p>

<p>
Felt that emotional somber feeling again as this is another mile stone in this terrains and savegames history, stuff parked, going to savegame and then its all done <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0946 Saved game and shut down FS19, we are done for this season and terrain version <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then took backups of savegames and only thing left to do is to edit captured videos. So I'm going to sign off here for possible long time when doing edits before I return to a re-designed terrain to have some more Start From Zero fun <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
