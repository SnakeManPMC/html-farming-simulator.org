	<h2>2020-11-09 Fertilizing And Lime Spreading</h2>

<p>
2016 New farming day has started, lets see what we get to do today. This savegame now has 774 hours in it.
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.6 is still very much work in progress but man did I like yesterdays farming session on it. The additional trees and I believe some farm buildings as well add so much nice visuals instead of the endless empty areas with fields. I would have liked to add more stuff in, like cosmetics radio / mobile phone transmitter towers and high voltage power lines across fields, but those have to wait for next terrain upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Overall I'm enjoying v0.1.6 great deal now. My field work plan now includes eastern side of the terrain, so for next terrain upgrade I'll focus on western side, that would be the last upgrade and savegame port before finishing this savegame.
