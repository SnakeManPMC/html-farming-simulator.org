	<h2>2019-11-30 Cultivating And Fertilizing</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-11-30T0159</b> New farming day has started, FS19 booted up.
</p>

<p>
Did not actually plan on playing, I'm already at the last part of this day as I've been ArmA 3 editing for quite some time. Now just felt like doing something else and decided to give hour or two for Start From Zero.
</p>

<p>
Was going to start fertilizing F12 but it didn't stick, have to cultivate first. Darn new seasons starter year and random field status.
</p>

<p>
0212 Started cultivating F12, courseplay ETA 30min, 4x tools<br>
? Finished cultivating F12<br>
0308 Started fertilizing F12, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
0332 Finished fertilizing F12<br>
0335 Started cultivating F13, courseplay ETA 52min, 4x tools<br>
0434 Finished cultivating F13
</p>

<p>
There is now a lone weed patch in F03 which I had pre-emptively blanket herbicide sprayed... seems like seasons weed code is buggy, huh?
</p>

<p>
0437 Started fertilizing F13, courseplay ETA 33min, 2x tools<br>
0516 Finished fertilizing F13<br>
0522 Started fertilizing F15, courseplay ETA min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
Now there is one weed spec in the SE corner of F14 heh. I truly wonder if the weeds will grow back just as I had never sprayed them, that would be really funny.
</p>

<p>
0549 Finished fertilizing F15<br>
0558 Started cultivating F16, courseplay ETA 50min, 4x tools<br>
0703 Finished cultivating F16
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to call it a night, dead tired. Again not planning on farming tomorrow... but we'll see how things evolve.
</p>
