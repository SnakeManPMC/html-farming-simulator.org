	<h2>2020-12-20 A Busy Day At The Farm</h2>

<p>
<b>2020-12-20T1032</b> New farming day has started, this savegame now has 801hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
This day has already half way done when I got around of all my other computer chores and now it was time to continue farming. First thing to do is to catch up the current situation, it was 17/late-spring in-game 1222hrs, weather +16/10C and forecast, well doesn't really matter in planting season. Big Bud 747's with Bourgault air drills needed seed refill.
</p>

<p>
When inspecting Case IH Optum 300 CVX tractors pulling Great Plains YP-2425A planters was shocked to see that one of the planters were set to BARLEY instead of corn. Now F41 is messed up with one row of barley among the corn. Oh well will be interesting to harvest but who cares, harvest is harvest.
</p>

<p>
Great plains needed seed refill as well. This task requires me to drive elmers haulmaster auger wagons here which are able to refill these seeders from the top down position, semi trailer truck cannot reach that high.
</p>

<p>
Refilled fist elmers haulmaster with 70k liter of seeds and sent it on her way to F45 area where planting operations are continuing. Next field to plant is F09 all the way in terrains far NE corner, its a small field so we do that as corn. Bourgault air drills start to put canola down on F47.
