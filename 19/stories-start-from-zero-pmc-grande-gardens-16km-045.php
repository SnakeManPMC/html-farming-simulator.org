	<h2>2019-12-01 Courseplay Headland Corner Off The Course Bug</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-12-01T0020</b> New farming day has started, did not plan on this but got ArmA 3 edits done and it was time for PMC Gaming.
</p>

<p>
0026 Started cultivating F17, courseplay ETA 27min, 4x tools<br>
0105 Finished cultivating F17<br>
0107 Started fertilizing F17, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
0124 Started cultivating F17, courseplay ETA 27min, 4x tools<br>
0132 Finished fertilizing F17<br>
0211 Finished cultivating F17<br>
0213 Started fertilizing F17, courseplay ETA 19min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Second weed patch appeared on F03, also F05 I believe has grown even more weeds now. The weed system is broken in seasons or at least in this savegame. I don't know how it could be a bad savegame as two latest seasons versions were upgraded on the last day of the year. Oh well, I did the spraying so once everything else is set I'm going to reset the field to weedless state from dev console. The hell if I'm field working for no reason due bugs.
</p>

<p>
Just before fertilizing was done it started to rain. No big deal, nothing to harvest anytime soon and in FS19 clinical world any rain wont cause muddy conditions so we continue.
</p>

<p>
0237 Finished fertilizing F17<br>
0242 Started seeding canola F17, courseplay ETA 21min, 4x tools<br>
0310 Finished seeding canola F17<br>
0311 Started fertilizing F17, courseplay ETA 19min, 2x tools<br>
0337 Finished fertilizing F17
</p>

<p>
Weeds growing to F16 now heh, oh well, buggy seasons weed system.
</p>

<p>
0345 Started seeding soybeans F14, courseplay ETA 22min, 4x tools
</p>

<p>
Courseplay has a big problem especially with bug bud 747's pulling seed hawk setups that if you are using headlands there is a big chance of the tractors to go off course on the corners. Once they reach the inner "back and forth" part then they are good but its the headland which is very problematic.
</p>

<p>
On this F14 course I had three (3)! tractors go off course, on previous F17 seeding I recall two tractors did that.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely infuriating to see that happen! It also means with four tools you get into huge problems trying to get them back on course as its sometimes so difficult to see where in the course particular tractor belongs to.
</p>

<p>
Now I have a streak of soybeans in F12 SE corner coming up about middle of the field (that was when I spotted the off course tractor). Now I need to cultivate that field under before fertilizing (I think).
</p>

<p>
I was seriously considering rage quitting this time, but calmed myself down that just deal with this courseplay bullshit and move on.
</p>

<p>
Oh, if you do not use headlands then there are no problems, but then again if you have trees or other obstacles near the field edges... you have to use headland.
</p>

<p>
It sucks.
</p>

<p>
0417 Finished seeding soybeans F14<br>
</p>

<p>
Upon finishing the field... I realized that this streaked tractor was not only off course but it was configured to seed CANOLA in the begin with, haha oh shieet maan what a fuck up this seeding was! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to cultivate under F12 and F14 next.
</p>

<p>
0422 Started cultivating F14, courseplay ETA 49min, 2x tools<br>
0425 Started cultivating F12, courseplay ETA 52min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Coming back from first ALT-TAB... F14 trailing big bud 450 pulling flexicoil st820 cultivator was just about to breach motherfucking soybean seeded F03!
</p>

<p>
0433 I calmly without hesitation saved and exited FS19. I AM FUCKING DONE.
</p>
