	<h2>2022-04-29 Millionaire With Fertilizing Contracts</h2>

<p>
2022-04-29T16:22:38Z New farming day has started, this savegame now has 33hrs 26min in it.
</p>

<p>
Today was plan to do work in PMC Grande Gardens 16km, however it didn't turn out like that as I have no mood of editing or doing anything with it, only thing that interests me is some Start From Zero game-play here, in PMC Iowa Garden City 8km. So here we are, lets get to it.
</p>

<p>
Hmm when loading into this savegame I now remember how it ended up last night, soybeans are on high demand on Big Buy for 4.6k per 1k liters, that is crazy money... unfortunately with my luck if I were to buy soybeans harvest ready field and lease combine... this high demand would probably be over. Lets not risk it, it would be too gamey stuff.
</p>

<p>
But I am going to do research and record how long the high demand lasts.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 1436hrs, weather +25C/+16C and soybeans high demand 4609.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:05:38Z Finished fertilizing F155, contract, collected reward 37.3k. This contract actually finished while I was in the restroom heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:06:45Z Accepted fertilizing contract F157, for 44.3k.

<p>
2022-04-29T17:21:27Z Finished fertilizing F83, contract, collected reward 113.5k.
</p>

<p>
Rubicon 9000 needs a refill, only 745 liters left, perfect timing after this big field just finished. Soybeans high demand still 4630.
</p>

<p>
Purchased ten 2k liter fertilizer tanks for 32k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:26:11Z Accepted fertilizing contract F10, for 133k.
</p>

<p>
F10 was quite far, other side of the terrain, but the reward is 133k so absolutely I'll go do such contract. Hopefully I can manage it with one 9k liter fertilizer tank, it would not be fun to drive back and forth for a refill.
</p>

<p>
Hmm that reminds me of the semi-truck tanker trailer combo, it would come real handy as companion for rubicon. Maybe if I were to buy another rubicon then the tanker would be pretty much required.
</p>

<p>
This F10 will be done using courseplay driving rubicon 9000, I want to chill and watch real life farming videos from youtube.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:32:36Z Started fertilizing F10, contract, courseplay, ETA 52min.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-29T1732.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-29T1732.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
It felt really good to have two vehicles rolling under courseplay in iowa garden city, I love it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I have always been courseplay user in FS17 and FS19, of course there is always room for GPS driving every now and then too, but courseplay is where its at. Leaves you with so much time to write these farming stories and watch youtube real life farming videos <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:35:26Z Finished fertilizing F157, contract, collected reward 44.3k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 742.3k, money just keeps coming in with these crazy fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:37:26Z Accepted fertilizing contract F61. T8.320 with Bredal K165 had 5k liters (26%) solid fertilizer left, it was near the dealership so went to get a top-up.
</p>

<p>
Purchased ten 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k. Then bought 2 more.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T17:48:21Z Started fertilizing F61, contract, courseplay, ETA 1h 29min. Oh wow movie length courseplay ETA <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 1601hrs, weather +26C/+16C, soybeans high demand 4652.
</p>

<p>
Well here I was sitting and watching fertilizing happen automatically, at the moment of writing this rubicon still has 25min ETA which is no fun waiting task. Sure I'm watching youtube farming videos on the side, but still its kind of <i>"yawn, so what am I gonna do now.."</i> heh.
</p>

<p>
Went to quickly check something on PMC DevSurf computer, it was a mere 5min or so, I don't switch computers if playing.
</p>

<p>
With the budget I have, it would be doable to purchase another bredal k165 tractor setup, that would beef up the long endurance fertilizing. But hmm dunno, I don't want to get too greedy, once these contracts are done... then its a while again before another set comes available and after that its going to be a whole year before more. I need to think long term, so going to just chill and work with the quipment at hand.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T18:21:33Z Finished fertilizing F10, contract, collected reward 133k.
</p>

<p>
Rubicon was pretty low on juice, decided to head back to the dealership but on my way there are three tiny fields, the 90 series 0, 1 and 2 so I'm going to take those and quickly get them done while rolling by them. I am not going to waste copy-paste and typing time to write them all down, I'll just do a onliner confirmation if they all got done nicely and my fertilizer tank lasted (its got 1.7k left).
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T18:29:30Z All tiny fields 90, 91 and 92 contracts completed.
</p>

<p>
Drove rubicon to the dealership and topped it up.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T18:34:41Z Accepted fertilizing contract F99.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T18:38:34Z Started fertilizing F99, contract, courseplay, ETA 42min.
</p>

<p>
Decided to drive remaining 10% contract on that bredal tractor manually because courseplay made that time wasting diagonal up-n-down course to it. Meaning that instead of doing long passes it does that zig-zag style short passes. I really don't know why/how courseplay does that. Me driving it using GPS is 100% efficient and ten times quicker.
</p>

<p>
Also was somewhat bored just watching farming videos so it was a nice to have something to do.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:04:00Z Finished fertilizing F61, contract, collected reward 116.1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:04:47Z Accepted fertilizing contract F63.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:06:03Z Started fertilizing F63, contract, courseplay, ETA 1h 12min.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:16:05Z Finished fertilizing F99, contract, collected reward 110.7k.
</p>

<p>
It might not be the most efficient way of doing contracts but I'm only taking one at the time, taking the most profitable ones. Last time to my best recollection, when I took ALL the fertilizing contracts, many of them turned out to be <i>"you have no access to this land"</i> also I don't want to get greedy and perhaps lose the most profitable ones.
</p>

<p>
Who knows maybe in a grand scheme of thing it would be best to just take them all and do what is closest to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:19:36Z Accepted fertilizing contract F196. This one was straight across the dealership using straight line where I'm at, well at least I get to refill on my way there but I bet there would be tons of easy contracts along the way, oh well lets just do them one at the time now even if it means driving back and forth, a bit.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 1729hrs, weather +25C/+16C, now that disgusting "FS19 Glow" appears on the horizon again, night is approaching soon, don't have many hours of daylight left.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:26:49Z Started fertilizing F196, contract, courseplay, ETA 34min.
</p>

<p>
Well here we go another half an hour of waiting, neither vehicle needs a refill so all I can do is wait.
</p>

<p>
Oh didn't even notice, we broke budget of one million! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.085m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 1743hrs, weather +25C/+16C, soybeans high demand 4679.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:56:11Z Finished fertilizing F196, contract, collected reward 85.9k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T19:58:21Z Accepted fertilizing contract F178.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:02:01Z Started fertilizing F178, contract, courseplay, ETA 20min.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:13:43Z Accepted fertilizing contract F89.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:19:15Z Finished fertilizing F178, contract, collected reward 59.1k.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay failed to generate course for F89, decided to go do that field with rubicon driving with GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:25:02Z Drove rubicon 9000 to the dealership and decided to take a lunch break here, kind of get, not exactly bored but... need a short break.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:52:02Z Feeding time over, lets get that F89 fertilized.
</p>

<p>
Purchased ten 2k liter fertilizer tanks for 32k. Topped up them rubicons.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T20:55:48Z Started fertilizing F89, contract, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:14:21Z Finished fertilizing F89, contract, collected reward 63k.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 1922hrs, weather +24C/+16C, soybeans no longer in high demand. So overall high demand lasted from 1436hrs to probably close to 1900hrs.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:17:30Z Accepted fertilizing contract F116. Going to send bredal k165 to handle this contract, but first sending him to top-up by the dealership (it snow 33%).
</p>

<p>
Purchased ten 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k. Purchased two more for 3.8k. Refilled bredal k165 to 96% full, then off to F116 in the east.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:27:56Z Started fertilizing F116, contract, courseplay, ETA 57min. Courseplay generated horrible diagonal time wasting course again, sigh. Oh well, I got youtube farming videos to watch.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:35:35Z Accepted fertilizing contract F67.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:40:43Z Started fertilizing F67, contract, courseplay, ETA 19min.
</p>

<p>
The eastern F116 had courseplay tractor getting stuck on the east side utility poles, should have used 2 headlands.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T21:59:59Z Finished fertilizing F67, contract, collected reward 60.8k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:00:41Z Accepted fertilizing contract F45. Rubicon only has 2.4k liters of fertilizer left, I doubt its enough for this next field but lets see what happens.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:03:55Z Started fertilizing F45, contract, courseplay, ETA 15min.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:16:38Z Finished fertilizing F116, contract, collected reward 65.6k.
</p>

<p>
Rubicon ran out of fertilizer while contract was % complete... hah I wrote that/this paragraph before contract actually completed while rubicon had FOUR (4) liters of fertilizer left <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:18:27Z Finished fertilizing F45, contract, collected reward 45.4k.
</p>

<p>
Both vehicles finished contracts pretty much at the same time, this always gets me extremely anxious or almost panic alike when I'm accepting new contracts, drive vehicles to the fields and start courseplays. Once both vehicles are running I'm calm and happy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yes I know, its weird, hehe!
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Decided to go for it and take ALL the remaining fertilizing contracts which cuts back my workload and time to find/drive the next field, if any contracts bug out, well tough luck but I'm not going to pick up these remaining not so high reward contracts one by one anymore.
</p>

<p>
Also I am not going to write three lines per contract anymore, I'll just add when one finishes and I'm collecting the reward. Yeah, call me lazy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:30:00Z Started fertilizing contract F114, and went to drive rubicon to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
I am really missing that semi-truck tanker trailer right about now. In the dealership I refilled rubicon.
</p>

<p>
F158 and F163 are so small I decided to do it with rubicon GPS driving.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-29T22:40:14Z F158 and F163 completed and reward collected, hooyah!
</p>

<p>
F161 and F162 are same size and shape back to back, I'm going to fertilize them with one pass.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 2116hrs, weather +23C/+16C, had to turn on rubicon 9000 lights, night is falling and its getting dark fast.

</p>

<p>
F171 was so narrow and close to utility poles that it was nightmare to fertilize in complete darkness heh, luckily it was just one pass as it was tiny field.
</p>

Okay its pitch black dark now, 01/early-summer in-game 2217hrs, weather +22C/+16C, after next contract is complete I'm going to time accelerate until daylight. Hopefully there wont be any issues with these contracts completing by themselves or something.

<p>
Feels good to be in daylight again, it started to get a bit depressing trying to navigate from field to field in complete darkness. Good to see beautiful PMC Iowa Garden City 8km landscapes again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-30T00:29:46Z Finished fertilizing F175, contract, collected reward 40k.
