	<h2>Iowa, Garden City, From Zero UNOFFICIAL Better Contracts</h2>

<p>
Please read the background idea for <a href="stories.php">our farm sim stories</a> so you understand what is this all about.
</p>

<p>
What you are reading is Unofficial Start From Zero, you can check out the original <a href="stories-from-zero-garden-city-iowa.php">Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km (pre re-design version)</a> to see what happened in 2019. Also check out yet another <a href="stories-from-zero-iowa-garden-city-unofficial.php">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Start From Zero unofficial</a>, yes I have done way too many of these, sorry <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-01T1847</b> Started <a href="pmc-iowa-garden-city-8km.php">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km</a> v1.1.1 farm-manager mode in single player and saved career. Then edited savegame for Start From Zero mode <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1857 Accepted contract for cultivating F151<br>
1858 Started cultivating F151, contract. Manually no GPS.<br>
1920 Finished cultivating F151, contract, collected contract reward 2.3k.
</p>

<p>
Back in Farming Simulator 19 playing since I took a short break from 2021-03-09 until now. Felt good to cultivate field driving manually, didn't honestly get into the exciting hyperventilating feeling, was just nice to drive while watching youtube real life farming video queue.
</p>

<p>
Driving manually versus GPS or completely hands free courseplay, that is the question. I honestly cannot remember how the previous unofficial Start From Zero savegames were done, I recall it was just courseplay use from beginning after doing first few perhaps manually, once the manual driving got old, which it does quite quickly.
</p>

<p>
1926 Accepted contract for cultivating F153<br>
1927 Started cultivating F153, contract. Manually no GPS.<br>
1946 Finished cultivating F153, contract, collected contract reward 3.5k.
</p>

<p>
Now I have done two fields driving completely manually, its time to switch into courseplay use mode and stack up those multiple cultivating etc contracts at once to get some nice progress done.
</p>

<p>

2044 Finished cultivating F150, contract, collected contract reward 4.1k.<br>
2045 Finished cultivating F155, contract, collected contract reward 8.8k.<br>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-01T2246.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-01T2246.jpg" class="imgresponsive" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame"></a>

<p>
2301 Finished cultivating F97, contract, collected contract reward 6.9k.<br>
2302 Finished cultivating F152, contract, collected contract reward 13.7k.
</p>

<p>
So its been several hours time to check things on the farm. Budget now 66.3k which is pretty nice, I could now lease decent solid fertilizer equipment and buy some fertilizer too, so I'm going to time accelerate until fertilizing contracts appear.
</p>

<p>
Time acceleration is done with 600 speed to ensure there is no desync field stage issues.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 1805hrs night is falling quickly and first fertilizing contract appeared. We are getting to make some money tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Overnight no new fertilizing contracts appeared, current one is for F160 which pays only 22k, not sure if its worth to lease tractor and spreader, so I'm going to time accelerate until more fertilizing contracts appear, at least 50k worth total.
</p>

<p>
2329 Accepted contract for plowing F154<br>
2333 Started plowing F154, contract, courseplay ETA 1h 8min<br>
2335 Accepted contract for plowing F156<br>
2339 Started plowing F156, contract, courseplay ETA 4h 27min<br>
<b>2021-04-02T0054</b> Finished plowing F154, contract, collected contract reward 10.2k.<br>
0127 Accepted contract for cultivating F70<br>
0134 Started cultivating F70, contract, courseplay ETA 56min<br>
0140 Accepted contract for cultivating F79<br>
0147 Started cultivating F79, contract, courseplay ETA 1h 27min<br>
0226 Finished cultivating F70, contract, collected contract reward 8.2k.<br>
0309 Finished cultivating F79, contract, collected contract reward 17.4k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 102.2k which is pretty nice, three digits money. Guess I have been playing several hours but somehow while watching those real life farming youtube videos from the queue time has been passed quickly.
</p>

<p>
Seasons and better contracts mods cause this time huge number of cultivating AND plowing missions to appear. The current F156 plowing contract using that titan 18 plow was a mistake though, its four and a half hour duration was pretty crazy. I need to be more careful when accepting those contracts because giants default implements are so poor for plowing. While writing this the duration is about fifty minutes so we are almost there. Also its getting dark so once this contract is done then we time accelerate to morning daylight.
</p>

<p>
0401 Finished plowing F156, contract, collected contract reward 23.8k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 126k. Night has fallen, going to time accelerate until morning daylight in hopes of getting fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
03/early-spring in-game 0645hrs, one new fertilizing contract appeared, now its worth to lease solid fertilizer setup.
</p>

<p>
0410 Accepted contract for fertilizing F70 and F160<br>
0412 Leased valtra A series with engine upgrade and GPS for 4.3k initial cost and bredal K105 with extension and spreading discs for 2.4k initial cost<br>
0413 Purchased 10 solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k<br>
0417 Started fertilizing F160, contract, manually with GPS<br>
0429 Finished fertilizing F160, contract, collected contract reward 22k.<br>
0432 Started fertilizing F70, contract, manually with GPS<br>
0449 Finished fertilizing F70, contract, collected contract reward 31.2k.
</p>

<p>
Then drove leased tractor and spreader back to the dealership, unloaded fertilizer and returned the equipment. As usual its way too expensive to keep leased vehicles and time accelerate for new fertilizing contracts, which might not even come.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 153.3k, hmm wonder if I should lease seeding equipment as there are so many contracts which nice rewards. Seeds cost of course, but hmm. Oh well going to time accelerate waiting for fertilizing contracts, looking for another 50k or so total reward contract list, hopefully more.
</p>

<p>
03/early-spring in-game 1205hrs, oh my a whole bunch of fertilizing contracts appeared, JUST after me writing its too expensive to keep leased vehicles while time accelerating heh, oh well lets lease new ones.
</p>

<p>
0459 Leased bredal k105 with extension and spreading discs for 2.4k initial cost<br>
0500 Leased fendt 500 favorit with engine upgrade and gps for 5.5k initial cost<br>
0503 Purchased 10 solid fertilizer 1k liter pallets for 19.2k<br>
0505 Accepted contract for fertilizing F113, F115, F116, F118 and F119<br>
0512 Started fertilizing F113, contract, manually with GPS<br>
0534 Was really tired, had to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
1353 Back at PMC Gaming new farming day has started, second day in this savegame which now has 10hrs and 43min in it.
</p>

<p>
We have several fertilizing contracts open and will continue working on those. Its a good start for any farming day <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Something odd happened right after logging into game, F118 contract got finished... even though my spreading tractor wasn't nowhere near the field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well I'll take the money if game gives it to me, I believe this is long going contracts bug that cause contracts to be finished for no reason. In PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero career there was several fertilizer and herbicide contracts which got completed by themselves, I recall activation is triggered on savegame load. I would never take a lot of contracts and then restart game just to see if they are completed just to get the money quickly, that's not the way I farm, but surely if the game bugs and gives me money I'll take it.
</p>

<p>
1355 Finished fertilizing F118, contract, collected contract reward 5.7k.<br>
1404 Finished fertilizing F113, contract, collected contract reward 57.1k.<br>
1405 Started fertilizing F115, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1422 Finished fertilizing F115, contract, collected contract reward 32k.
</p>

<p>
Then it was lunch break time, days first meal. As I'm using GPS manual driving I need to take a clean break while I eat. Fertilizing contracts continue after this meal.
</p>

<p>
1452 Feeding time is over, lets continue fertilizing<br>
1453 Started fertilizing F116, contract, manually with GPS
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T1456.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T1456.jpg" class="imgresponsive" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame"></a>

<p>
Fendt Favorit 515C and Bredal K105 with extension and spreader discs is pretty nice cheap starter fertilizing package.
</p>

<p>
1509 Finished fertilizing F116, contract, collected contract reward 28.4k.<br>
1510 Started fertilizing F119, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1512 Finished fertilizing F119, contract, collected contract reward 3.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 249.4k oh wow almost two fifty kay, that is quite nice starter money to purchase first fertilizing equipment. This fendt favorit 515C with GPS costs 108.5k which is quite cheap and it pulls small bredal spreader just fine.
</p>

<p>
Drove leased vehicles to dealership, unloaded fertilizer and returned equipment. Lets hope no new fertilizer contracts appear after few hours in-game time heh.
</p>

<p>
There are endless list of seeding, cultivating and plowing contracts. I'm still not sure how profitable seeding contracts are as the equipment cost so much plus seeds themselves. But you could spent real life days just doing those seeding contracts that's for sure and the money you would get out of them, oh my.
</p>

<p>
So next I time accelerated in few hours increments, in-game is now 1407hrs so to 1800hrs and if still no new contracts then straight for tomorrow morning daylight. 03/early-spring in-game 1809hrs no new contracts. 04/mid-spring in-game 0704hrs, a long list of fertilizing contracts appeared, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
Now I'm actually thinking of purchasing my first own vehicles.
</p>

<p>
1533 Accepted contract for fertilizing F255, F256, F257, F258, F260, F265, F266, F113, F118 and F160
</p>

<pre>
- tractor new holland t6.175 with wide tires and gps for 144k
- bredal k165 with extension and spreader discs for 76k
</pre>
<p>
Purchased above list and then 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k
</p>

<p>
Felt really good to purchase our very first own equipment. Now its so nice to field work as we own our vehicles instead of living with leasing costs. Budget now 10.2k so it got pretty low but once we start to clear these contracts, it will soon rise <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1545 Started fertilizing F160, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1556 Finished fertilizing F160, contract, collected contract reward 22k.<br>

1724 Started fertilizing F113, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1756 Finished fertilizing F113, contract, collected contract reward 57.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget 209.4k heh back at two hundred thousand. Savegame is progressing very nicely. I'm not ready to take on cultivating or seeding contracts so lets just time accelerate again while we wait for fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-spring in-game 1506hrs two new fertilizing contracts appeared, these are not much but easily doable with our own equipment now.
</p>

<p>
1801 Accepted contract for fertilizing F165 and F166<br>
1808 Started fertilizing F165, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1813 Finished fertilizing F165, contract, collected contract reward 8.6k.<br>
1817 Started fertilizing F166, contract, courseplay ETA 18min<br>
1834 Finished fertilizing F166, contract, collected contract reward 28.5k.
</p>

<p>
All fertilizer contracts done again. Time accelerated until in-game 1806hrs, no new fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
05/mid-spring in-game 0720hrs, again bunch of new fertilizing contracts appeared, seems like many of the same ones I just previously did, guess they changed field stages and triggered another fertilization level. However game-play farming wise this is a bit... well boring, to go after the exact same fields as in previous day. But yeah, its money, so.
</p>

<p>
This point I was... not bored but... well, heh, bored. Kind of tired and just not much energy to repeat the same contracts right now. Maybe I'll take a few minutes break at least.
</p>

<p>
1924 Break is over, lets get back to farming. I'm going to take on those fertilizing contracts
</p>

<pre>
- tractor new holland t6.175 with wide tires and gps for 144k
- bredal k165 with extension and spreader discs for 76k
</pre>
<p>
Purchased above list and then 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k. Yes this is exact same copy paste of the one above, purchased same stuff and then was ready to take on more fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
1930 Accepted contract for fertilizing F113, F114, F117, F118, F121, F160, F165, F255, F256, F257, F258, F265 and F266<br>
1933 Started fertilizing F165, contract, courseplay ETA 7min<br>
1938 Started fertilizing F255, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1940 Finished fertilizing F165, contract, collected contract reward 8.6k.<br>
1941 Started fertilizing F160, contract, courseplay ETA 14min<br>
1947 Finished fertilizing F255, contract, collected contract reward 10.1k.<br>
1948 Started fertilizing F256, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1955 Finished fertilizing F160, contract, collected contract reward 22k.<br>
1957 Finished fertilizing F256, contract, collected contract reward 16.1k.<br>
1959 Started fertilizing F257, contract, courseplay ETA 8min<br>
2002 Started fertilizing F265, contract, courseplay ETA 22min<br>
2006 Finished fertilizing F257, contract, collected contract reward 12.4k.<br>
2007 Started fertilizing F258, contract, manually with GPS<br>
2023 Finished fertilizing F258, contract, collected contract reward 28.5k.<br>
2024 Finished fertilizing F265, contract, collected contract reward 33.1k.
</p>

<p>
And now it was lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2049 Feeding time over, fertilizing continues<br>
2050 Started fertilizing F266, contract, courseplay ETA 9min<br>
2058 Finished fertilizing F266, contract, collected contract reward 8.8k.
</p>

<p>
Southern part contracts are done, drove first free spreader to dealership and second followed. Purchased 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k. Refilled first bredal spreader. Then purchased another 10 pallets for 19.2k, heh a lot of money for product <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Later purchased third 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallet for 19.2k and refilled second spreader, then sent it on its way to meet first spreader by F121.
</p>

<p>
2111 Started fertilizing F121, contract, courseplay ETA 22min<br>
2128 Finished fertilizing F121, contract, collected contract reward 33.7k.<br>
2130 Started fertilizing F117, contract, manually with GPS<br>
2132 Finished fertilizing F117, contract, collected contract reward 2.4k.<br>
2135 Started fertilizing F118, contract, courseplay ETA 5min<br>

2140 Started fertilizing F113, contract, courseplay ETA 36min<br>
2141 Started fertilizing F114, contract, courseplay ETA 18min
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T2141.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T2141.jpg" class="imgresponsive" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame"></a>

<p>
Two last fields were being worked on, side by side fields two bredal spreaders putting down fertilizer, it was a beautiful sight <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Already planning my next move, budget ... well dunno what it will be once these fields are done, but those seeding contracts are so high paying and there are SO MANY of them that they are extremely enticing. Still no idea what kind of horror time sink it would be if I'd buy some small to medium size seeder like pronto 9dc, I think that would take way too long to seed many of these fields as I recall even seed hawk the field work times were really long.
</p>

<p>
But, those contracts are there and good to go while fertilizing contracts are always locked behind some time accelerating. Thinking about the big picture it would be really cool to have cultivating, fertilizing and seeding equipment for that all around contract work. But that would be very expensive obviously.
</p>

<p>
Dunno guess I'll time accelerate to in-game afternoon to see if any fertilizing contracts appear.
</p>

<p>
2158 Finished fertilizing F114, contract, collected contract reward 30.3k.<br>
2206 Finished fertilizing F113, contract, collected contract reward 57.1k.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T2206.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-02T2206.jpg" class="imgresponsive" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame"></a>

<p>
Budget now 218.5k heh nice considering we have TWO bredal big spreaders <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Next it was time accelerating waiting for more fertilizing contracts. 06/mid-spring in-game 0701hrs, btw I noticed how field stages just switched after skipping the night, and sure enough same and few new fertilizing contracts appeared again, nice lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
2221 Accepted contract for fertilizing F114, F117, F121, F165, F255, F256, F257, F258, F265 and F271
</p>

<p>
Best part was that closest field was... right next to our equipment, F114 hehe.
</p>

<p>
2224 Started fertilizing F114, contract, courseplay ETA 12min, 2x tools<br>
2235 Finished fertilizing F114, contract, collected contract reward 30.3k.<br>
2237 Started fertilizing F117, contract, manually with GPS<br>
2238 Finished fertilizing F117, contract, collected contract reward 2.4k.<br>
2241 Started fertilizing F121, contract, courseplay ETA min ...
</p>

<p>
... was just starting that F121 field work course... when courseplay froze FS19 up completely that I had to task manager kill the whole task. This is known issue happening sometimes and usually I savegame right before starting a course so I don't lose any progress, but this time I didn't save. I already know at bare minimum I lost that F114 and F117 fertilizing, sigh.
</p>

<p>
Started FS19 with hopes that I did save after F114 but I doubt it (cant recall). NNNGGHH! I did not save, didn't even have that time acceleration on it... so basically we need to skip back to real life time 2206hrs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Man this sucks, but I pushed on, doing all that crap since 2206hrs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-03T0000.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-04-03T0000.jpg" class="imgresponsive" loading="lazy" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame"></a>

<p>
So did all that field work which was lost, time skip, F114 fert, and then realized I didn't even get the big 100k contract, fuck this sucks. I'm just going to do whatever it gives me now without writing it down I'm so sick of this shit. While doing that... I made the mistake of starting F121 multiple tools course again without saving and it froze, hehe DOUBLE WHAMMY MOTHERFUCKER. <b>Sigh</b> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-03T0035</b> Finished all but one contract and was in so pissed off mood that decided to watch TV rest of the day. I'll feel better tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
1403 New farming day has started, I don't even want to look above whats happened last nite. This savegame now has 20hrs and 17mins in it
</p>

<p>
Today we continue doing fertilizing contracts, with frequent savegames, dunno maybe I'll try one or two seeding contracts, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Still have one more fertilizing contract to do from last night, F165 which is a small GPS driven one. That will be done quicker than another tractor can follow us up there using courseplay.
</p>

<p>
1416 Finished fertilizing F165, all contracts done
</p>

<p>
Budget now 393.8k oh wow that is a lot of money.
</p>

<p>
Then had to shutdown FS19 to restore last good version of courseplay as todays github update broke keypad 7 start/stop course keyboard shortcut. Why do people always take perfectly good working thing and break them, I don't get it, I see this all the time, its one step forward and two steps back.
</p>

<p>
1423 FS19 booted back up with properly working courseplay<br>
1424 Purchased 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets and refilled bredal spreaders
</p>

<p>
06/mid-spring in-game 0853hrs, no more contracts so time accelerating.
</p>

<p>
1428 Accepted contract for fertilizing F110, F111, F122, F123<br>
1435 Started fertilizing F111, contract, courseplay ETA 19h min<br>
1442 Started fertilizing F110, contract, courseplay ETA 20min
</p>

<p>
Then it was lunch break while tractors are spreading some fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
1451 Finished fertilizing F111, contract, collected contract reward 28.3k.<br>
1501 Finished fertilizing F110, contract, collected contract reward 27.8k.<br>
1510 Feeding time over, back to fertilizing<br>
1515 Started fertilizing F122, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1517 Finished fertilizing F122, contract, collected contract reward 2k.<br>
1518 Started fertilizing F123, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1522 Finished fertilizing F123, contract, collected contract reward 7.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 439.9k pretty nice.
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate one more day to see if few more fertilizing contracts would appear, if not or when those are done, then I think its seeding contract time or perhaps think about buying cultivating equipment of our own as there are so many of those contracts.
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 0732hrs, new fertilizing contracts appeared, lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
1532 Accepted contract for fertilizing F111, F122, F166, F260<br>
1534 Started fertilizing F122, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1536 Finished fertilizing F122, contract, collected contract reward 2k.<br>
1540 Started fertilizing F111, contract, courseplay ETA 20min<br>
1550 Finished fertilizing F111, contract, collected contract reward 28.3k.<br>
1557 Started fertilizing F166, contract, courseplay ETA 20min<br>
1608 Finished fertilizing F166, contract, collected contract reward 28.5k.<br>
1619 Started fertilizing F260, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1622 Finished fertilizing F260, contract, collected contract reward 4.9k.
</p>

<p>
On that last field the second tractor did not manage to follow drive in there before field was fertilized F260 was that small.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 503.7k half a million in cash, aayeah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I needed to check what sort of seeding equipment we could buy now and what those capabilities are. As said many times I'm only expert on the largest equipment I really don't know much about the small and medium sized stuff, yes I've used pronto 9dc and amazone 15001 or whatever that was many times, I like pronto 9dc as it goes 18km/h and is therefore very fast small width implement, but yeah otherwise don't have much experience.
</p>

<p>
Would be waste of time to purchase some medium size seeder which then would cause huge 4+ hrs field works on seeding contracts, I rather use the time with seeding contracts and get much more money with less real life gaming time.
</p>

<p>
Amazone condor 15001 is 15m wide, holds 8000 liters of seeds (optional fertilization mod), requires only 270 horsepower but only goes 10km/h which is dreadfully slow, not sure why optional fertilization mod adjusted its speed to so slow as giants condor goes 18km/h.
</p>

<p>
Horsch pronto 9 dc is 9m wide, holds 5000 liters of seeds (optional fertilization mod), requires same 270 horsepower and goes 18km/h.
</p>

<p>
Going bigger than that... well then we are going to the bourgault 3320-76 and seed hawk setups which are the big boy stuff with size, horsepower requirements and cost.
</p>

<p>
If I had to choose now a small to medium size seeder, it still would be horsch pronto 9 dc with optional fertilization mod for that 5k liters seed capacity. I would have to buy a seeding tractor as my current small new holland t6's just don't have the horsepower for it. Perhaps I could buy a tractor which could pull both seeder and cultivator hmm.
</p>

<p>
Cultivator john deere 2410 5 section requires 400hp while flexicoil st820 requires 500hp.
</p>

<p>
Such setup would require tractor massey ferguson 8700 with engine + tires + gps upgrade which has 400hp and costs 325k.
</p>

<p>
Checked out my first contracts game-mode start from zero story about seeding contracts, my only comments came after short attempt with horsch pronto 9 dc which was experienced to be too small, it takes just way too long to see fields larger than 10ha. Then later I did not write much about experiences if its good or bad, but I did do huge number like almost couple of days worth of seeding using big bud 747 and seed hawk with optional fertilization mod.
</p>

<p>
That combination is the age old working setup, however in late 2020 I had desire to move from highly unique big bud 747 to something more mainstream factory line tractor, while 747 is realistic as there is ONE (1) of those tractors in the world you could use ONE in your savegame, but that is borderline unrealistic because the fact that its such an unique once in a life time tractor. When you compare it to some case quadtrac 620 or something like this which every other big farm owns, there is no comparison really.
</p>

<p>
Anyways as basic seeding, the seed hawk already costs 290k for the toolbar and 185k for the air cart which is 475k total. Bourgault 3320-76 drill is 273.5k and 7950 air cart is 272k which is 545.5k total. In this case seed hawk wins as its cheaper, wider and holds more seeds. If you switch to the bourgault 3420-100 that is again very rare real life implement and the drill alone costs 430.5k, so yeah big boy stuff is definitely seed hawk with optional fertilization.
</p>

<p>
But a tractor to pull seed hawk which requires 640hp is another half a million heh, for example challenger mt900e with engine upgrade, dual tires and gps is 511.5k, geez.
</p>

<p>
Dunno man, its clear that I would need 986.5k money to purchase seed hawk setup. With the big bud 747 price would drop a lot but as said I'd like to avoid it and I don't even have that mod installed now.
</p>

<p>
Uuh these questions about growing your farm and making best decisions are hard <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So for now I'm going to time accelerate and wait for more fertilizing contracts, I might... maybe... do few cultivating contracts to open up more fields to fertilizing contract use.
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 1208hrs, new fertilizing contracts appeared. Back to work.
</p>

<p>
1715 Accepted contract for fertilizing F263, F264, F267, F268
</p>

<p>
And again courseplay froze whole FS19 and partly computer (mouse would not move from center screen) when attempting to start a multiple tools course, this is just hopeless. Luckily I learned my lesson and saved game so nothing was lost.
</p>

<p>
1720 Started fertilizing F264, contract, courseplay ETA 26min<br>
1722 Started fertilizing F263, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1724 Finished fertilizing F267, contract, collected contract reward 25.8k. Ehh? I did not even start this <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

1738 Finished fertilizing F268, contract, collected contract reward 7.8k.<br>
1742 Finished fertilizing F264, contract, collected contract reward 35.3k.
</p>

<p>
That is it, all contracts done once again. Budget now 591.8k. Now we could buy rubicon 9000 but dunno if that is necessary because these two bredal k165's can do decent job getting these few fertilizing contracts done, what we need is more contracts not better equipment.
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 1811hrs, three new fertilizing contracts appeared.
</p>

<p>
1751 Accepted contract for fertilizing F246, F248, F252<br>
1758 Started fertilizing F252, contract, courseplay ETA 15min<br>

1816 Started fertilizing F246, contract, courseplay ETA 19min
</p>

<p>
Was snoozing off while playing, steered off courseplay line heh, ok its time to take a nap.
</p>

<p>
2053 Nap is over, FS19 booted back up, we continue fertilizing F246...<br>
2055 Finished fertilizing F246, contract, collected contract reward 32.4k.
</p>

<p>
If you paid attention to above minutes, you see that it took mere 2 minutes to finish that field... except it didn't, not really, when I started FS19, loaded savegame up and first time checked contracts menu, this contract was already completed even though in reality I had only fertilized headland and almost one pass. So yes FS19 bugged out again with those self completing contracts. Well hey I take the free money for sure <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then again same continues, more time accelerating waiting for new fertilizing contracts. Budget now 664.3k which is pretty nice. Not sure what I buy next, rubicon? cultivator? seeder? Options, options! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
08/late-spring in-game 0636hrs, bunch of new fertilizing contracts appeared, ah yes more money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
This batch of fertilizing contracts were mostly surrounding the vehicle shop area, where we started doing cultivating contracts in day 1.

2328 Finished fertilizing F150, contract, collected contract reward 15.8k.
</p>

<p>
Another set of fertilizing contracts done. I have listed most fields above to be without 2x tools but I have in fact started one tool normal field work course but my second tractor spreader is driven by me manually starting from the END of the course, then tractors meet at the middle and before that contract is already completed.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 892.8k which is quite awesome load of cash. Unfortunately still not enough cash to purchase big 600+ hp tractor and seed hawk setup, so I need to go through at least one cycle of fertilizing contracts. Yes I could of course lease, but I rather not, it feels so cheap and dumb as you pay huge fees to use those vehicles, when you just save money and buy them then there are no crap costs to bleed you dry.
</p>

<p>
Drove bredal spreader tractors to dealership and bought two 10 1k liter solid fertilizer pallets for 19.2k, refilled bredal spreaders.
</p>

<p>
09/late-spring in-game 0716hrs, new fertilizing contracts appeared already yesterday afternoon but I skipped the whole night anyways. Now finally the big F271 contract for 100k reward appeared, nice.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-04T0000</b> Accepted contract for fertilizing F148, F151, F154, F155, F156, F161, F164, F167, F246, F261, F262, F267, F268, F271
</p>

<p>
Two of these contracts offered rubicon 9000 as borrowed vehicle, I took them both. I cannot recall if FS19 allows borrowed vehicle to be used in any other field than what is it designated for, I believe it should work on all your owned fields but we'll soon see. Need to document that down now for future reference.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10 2k liter liquid fertilizer tanks for 32k, refilled rubicons and then tried rubicon to the closest field, worked just fine. Okay we are good to go.

</p>

<p>
Uah big batch of fertilizing contracts done, this feels like the largest set I've done so far, also those rubicon's helped a lot but also made it more complex task to hustle all those vehicles. Especially as I could not collect contract rewards as I didn't want to lose those rubicon borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
After all contracts were completed rubicons still had over 15% liquid fertilizer left so I drove them to the dealership and unloaded product. Gotta save all our expensive stuff. Then I collected all contract rewards therefore returning those borrowed rubicons.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.171 million <img src="../images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah buddy, I am millionaire now. So now I could purchase high horsepower tractor and seed hawk for those seeding contracts.
</p>

<p>
Browsed through all normal grain (non corn or sugar beet etc) seeding contracts and the rewards totaled to 1.524 MILLION. I was shocked <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This amount of seeding field work of course eats a lot of seed product, so you cant just convert that money number to actual cash profit, but basically you could say that if I buy even that expensive bourgault seeding equipment and do these contracts... I make all the money back which was used to buy the equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Another thing of course is that such seeding operation without a doubt whatsoever is a multiple real life day game-play session, I cannot imagine it being completed anything sooner than two full days of playing, based on my recollection how long it took to run one seed hawk in previous Start From Zero in this terrain.
</p>

<p>
That is a bit scary thought, am I ready for such undertaking? Hmm, not sure <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0200 Going to take a break to think this through, going to try Cattle and Crops v1.3.5.5
</p>

<p>
0225 That was sort lived test, still unoptimized and just didn't want to dig into a "new game" now. FS19 booted back up, we continue. This savegame now has 29hrs and 33min in it.
</p>

<pre>
- tractor challenger mt900 with engine upgrade, dual tires and gps for 511.5k
- air cart seed hawk fertilization disabled, dual rear wheels for 190k
- seeder seed hawk toolbar for 290k
</pre>

<p>
0232 Purchased above list, budget now 180.1k
</p>

<p>
Then purchased 10 2.1k liter seed pallets for 18.9k, refilled seed hawk and then bought another ten seed pallets for 18.9k and finished filling seed hawk.
</p>

<p>
Then accepted ALL normal grain seeding contracts, no point of writing them down here as it literally was close to 200+ contracts heh, it was just insane <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Mini map was flashing field numbers all around, this is going to take <b>several days of seeding</b> without a doubt. Interesting to see how many days do I bare, because ultimately... this savegame was just to have a little better contracts mod fun, not a legit Start From Zero, so I'm most likely going to end playing this savegame fairly soon. We'll see, one contract at the time.
</p>

<p>
0250 Started seeding canola F145, contract, courseplay ETA 47min<br>
0331 Finished seeding canola F145, contract, collected contract reward 50.8k.<br>
0333 Started seeding oat F84, contract, manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing contract appeared for newly seeded F145, oh my, I sense that the flood gates are about to open when I get few more fields seeded heh. Also too bad I decided to do this field driving manually using GPS for my boredom, because I could have now setup fertilizing contract. Oh well, next time.
</p>

<p>
Also I need to buy a pickup truck 1978 so I can quickly drive around recording courseplay courses.
</p>

<p>

0358 Accepted contract for fertilizing F145, F84<br>
0408 Finished seeding barley F86, contract, collected contract reward 18k.
</p>

<p>
Had some problems as game kept saying this is wrong fruit type for the contract, no matter what I changed on both air drill and air cart. Then when tried to start fertilizing contract for F145 it didn't allow me to, said I do not have access to this land. Hmm did I break FS19 with that many accepted contracts or what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Restarted FS19 to clear everything up. But F145 fertilizing contract still kept saying I do not have access to this land. So I cancelled the contract. I accepted it again and the same thing, no access to this land. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
F84 and F86 said the same thing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay now there is something seriously wrong with these contracts.
</p>

<p>
0418 Started seeding barley F95, contract, manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Well at least this field worked without giving wrong fruit type warning text. So the thing to understand here is power of better contracts mod, if I would take contracts one at the time assuming that might prevent these warnings, then whats the point of using better contracts mod if you are essentially playing like without it. Okay its not that black and white but to me the power of this mod is showing <i>the closest contract field</i> which was extremely frustrating to track down previously. This is just speculation at this point that accepting close to 200 contracts would cause issues, we'll see how this develops.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to do these seeding contracts now and hope there is no more warnings, I wont be refreshing contracts until a lot of seeding has been done.
</p>

<p>
0421 Finished seeding barley F95, contract, collected contract reward 5.6k.<br>
0426 Started seeding oat F99, contract, courseplay ETA 60min
</p>

<p>
This field said again wrong fruit type, but progress bar increased in contracts menu so I continued. Hmph. Wonder if this is something to do with seed hawk optional fertilization mod as air cart has two tanks now and not sure how to select the fertilizer tank as it now just states "Seeds". Maybe it fixes itself once seed tank runs out and it switched to fertilizer tank. Hope so. Edit: it didn't, at least not on the fly, maybe it does once I finish and start a new field, dunno.
</p>

<p>
0436 Lunch break ...<br>

- trailer semi-tipper 70000/6 for 69k
- semi truck warrior++ with engine upgrade for 146.7k

<p>
We need to haul seeds for seed hawk in the boonies, what better way than a semi truck and end dump grain trailer. Purchased above list, budget now 37.5k. Purchased 10 2.1k liter seed pallets for umm whatever it cost heh. Then bought another 9, budget now whopping 1.6k heh. Then refilled semi truck trailer with seeds.

Budget now 246.2k, hard to say if this seeding thing is good money as it kind of feels like half the evening was spent seeding, if same time would have been spent time accelerating and doing fertilizing contracts... yeah hard to say man.
</p>

<p>
And now its time to call it a night, its late and I'm tired. I will return to this tomorrow, I mean... what else would there to do heh.
</p>

<p>
1556 Back at PMC Gaming, lets continue seeding. This savegame now has 35hrs 27mins in it.

<p>
Attempted to fertilize F251 but it again did not work, you have no access to this land, sigh. Whats going on with contracts?
</p>

<p>
1623 Finished seeding oat F250, contract, collected contract reward 32.9k.<br>

1647 Had a lunch break here while seed hawk was seeding, all done eating days fist meal now
</p>

<p>
This fertilizing contracts not working has me very troubled. Currently F251 and F250 seeding oats works fine, no warning about wrong fruit type, seed hawk upper seed selector says "Seeds" and lower "Oat", dunno what that means in big picture. But fertilizing contracts not working is a big issue.
</p>

<p>
My plan now is to continue seeding using our challenger and seed hawk, currently budget is 278.9k so I'm going to LEASE another big tractor and the biggest bourgault drill and air cart, then put that to work on seeding as well. I want to get as many seeding contracts done today as possible, heck maybe even all of them. After they are done I can start to investigate if fertilizer contracts across the board are not working anymore or is there some bug in better contracts mod or in FS19 engine itself that too many open contracts just doesn't work. That would be really bad as then we are back to square one with "find your field" nonsense. Hopefully we learn more today.
</p>

<pre>
- seeder 600hp 30.5m bourgault 3420-100 paralink hoe drill 21.9k
- seeder air cart bourgault 71300 16.9k
- tractor 670hp john deere 9rx with engine upgrade and gps 26.8k
</pre>
<p>
1658 Leased above list, budget now 213.2k. At this point I really don't care much about my budget, I just want to learn how better contracts mod work with hundreds of open contracts, why those fertilizing contracts are giving me the no access to land error.

<p>
Its been a struggle to do these contracts as pretty much every other, almost feels like every field gives wrong fruit for this contract warning and those fertilization contracts access to land error. This crap just doesn't work. Guess I could cancel all remaining contracts, savegame and restart FS19, then see if I can take them back one by one and have better luck... but dunno, might be worth the shot. I'll see after these courseplay courses have now completed.

</p>

<p>
Night is falling fast and once F67 and F29 seeding finishes I'll be time accelerating until morning daylight so I can see something again. Also almost sneakily my budget has risen again to half a million, whoah how did that happen heh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its actually a bit odd that I have decent bredal solid fertilizer spreader and excellent seed hawk seeding setups... but not even maxed out rubicon + liquid tanker trailer setup yet, usually in Start From Zero savegames rubicon is the first goodie I go after heh.
</p>

<p>
Overall this savegame progress is now in a stage where the cheapo "zero" stuff is long gone, we have plenty of money and good equipment already. Next big change would be to buy land and start to farm our own fields, but I think that is out of scope for this just for fun game-play I'm doing now, heck I don't even remember <i>why</i> am I exactly playing my <i>third</i> unofficial Start From Zero in iowa garden city <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways, immediate goal is to figure out why those fertilizing contracts are not working. I'm probably going to restart FS19 after the night time skipping, who knows maybe that clears something up dunno.

Restarted FS19 just in case it might clear some of these contract issues up now with more seeding contracts finished. After restarting no changes on contracts board, oh well, okay lets skip the night.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
I messed up F02 seeding contract as the stupid game almost always says wrong fruit type for contract I didn't pay no mind to it... and sure enough this time it was true, contract was seeding soybeans but I accidentally left seeder to Oats, did two headlands before I realized it, while writing this I doubt that field can be saved anymore as it would require actual cultivating to erase the oats before putting soybeans in. And the contract buffer percentage completion thing is not large enough to cover those two headlands, so I guess this was a bust, but I'll let bourgault air drill do full courseplay course and then we'll see how much is left. Hell maybe I buy cultivator and quickly do the headland there.
</p>

<p>
Also now I can already see the end of seeding contracts board, not many left heh.
</p>

Had to cancel few seeding contracts as they did not work, F82, F163 and actually cancelled F273 as I could not see it on the mapview on lower left corner, too lazy to drive huge seeder all the way there just for 8k contract reward <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Restarted FS19 once again to clear everything up. This savegame now has 43hrs and 54min in it.
</p>

<p>
Absolutely huge list of fertilizing contracts appeared, obviously cant be sure but on rough overview it looks like all the fields I seeded, now have fertilizing contract available. That is just crazy amount of money... assuming the contracts work this time.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to take one contract which is nearby my existing new holland t6 bredal k165 spreader tractors so its quick drive to test if the field work or not.
</p>

<p>

<p>
I am really happy that fertilizing contracts work, not that it in any way "saved this savegame" but simply that better contracs mod is not completely broken. And heck we already seen for couple of days now that fertilizing contracts work fine, I guess FS19 was just overwhelmed by the probably hundred or more seeding contracts I accepted all at once.
</p>

<p>
This is still bad that if we cannot accept many or maybe even all contracts we want, like the above seeding ones, then benefits of better contracts mod diminishes greatly. It was so awesome to take all contracts with minimap flashing field numbers left and right, then just start doing them beginning from the closest field. If I need to take one or just few contracts at once... yeah then we are back to the hell we were with refresh contracts mod which leaves us baffled where is our contract field in relation to our vehicles (not exactly but you know what I mean).
</p>

<p>
Dunno maybe taking like one page full of contracts is fine but not so many as I did today with seeding contracts, that truly was crazy stuff.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Dunno what I'm doing now, fertilizing contracts are running, there is just huge list of them available for taking, budget is 941.2k which is a lot. Hmm guess I'm just farming here because I have nothing else to do today (what I would want to do) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
This was the field that did not work previously, also this contract had rubicon available as borrowed vehicle so I took it. Still got some liquid fertilizer tanks by the dealership so why not give rubicon a spin. Edit: this time field worked just fine, so must have been some "too many [seeding?] contracts active" bug or something.

So there you have it, some nice equipment and money one million, this savegame has ran out of its usefulness, I've had my fun with unofficial start from zero using better contracts mod, again.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-05</b> Its time to exit and delete this savegame, sad to let it go (no, not really heh) but we are end of the road here. There will be new from zero adventure in PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain once object placement is complete and terrain is ready for release, but that is still very distant dream in the horizon <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
