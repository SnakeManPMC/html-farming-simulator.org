<p>
<b>2021-05-04T23:15:00Z</b> Todays first farm yard trees placed, well actually this was farm yard that was cut off, the buildings are beyond terrain edge which are not present but the trees are which I now placed.
</p>

<p>
Did another location, no farm yard just trees by side of the road.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-05-05T01:02:00Z</b> Then did farm yard with spruce/pine trees and all.

This looks so stupid. These trees should have been placed within a day, maximum of two days. Now I have been struggling with boredom/burnout so I usually do one or two farm yards after days first meal just so I can mark changelog that I did something and then... then just slide into idling lazy mode where I stare monitor with blank look on my face, maybe watch some dumb twitch streams.

2021-05-05T08:33:00Z Did one more farm yard tree placement after idling half the day watching twitch live streams.
