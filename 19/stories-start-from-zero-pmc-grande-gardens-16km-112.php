	<h2>2021-05-10 Harvesting Soybeans F82</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-05-10T0800</b> Back at PMC Gaming, lets continue harvesting F82. This savegame now has 1019hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Didn't need to refuel vehicles this time, preparations to get F82 SW started took a while, I actually was on the background 15 or so minutes.

<p>
Alright F82 all 636ha is now harvested. As written previously this field was the one that winter ruined, but another try and had plenty of time to harvest it. Feels good to have it done.
</p>

<p>
Now there is still the 525ha of corn in F56, that is no joke either, it will take couple of real life days to harvest because I doubt I'll be pushing any 17hrs days anytime soon, for example right now I have no plans at all to start harvesting that, probably going to take few days break again. We'll see how it turns out.
