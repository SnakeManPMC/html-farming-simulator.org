	<h2>2021-03-07 Farmer_schubi Factories</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-03-07T1910</b> New farming day has started, was not planning on farming today, but I just have to. This savegame now has 24hrs 13mins in it.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow morning I cant use PMC Gaming computer at working hours for at least few days, so while I was not planning on playing today I want to do one last enjoyable contracts game-mode in PMC Grande Gardens 16km before tomorrow morning.
</p>

<p>
Reminder to myself mostly, its now 04/mid-summer in-game 0655hrs my budget is 1.250m, got F84 and F85 tiny 2.6ha fields fertilizing contracts which I'm probably not going to do because... why bother driving all the way up there for 10k reward total.
</p>

<p>
1920 Purchased pickup truck 1978 for 30k
</p>

<p>
Drove and recorded courseplay course to F84.
</p>

<p>
1930 Purchased 10 2k liter liquid fertilizer tanks for 32k, times two<br>
1935 Accepted contract for fertilizing F84 and F85<br>
1942 Started fertilizing F85, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1944 Finished fertilizing F85, contract, collected contract reward 5.4k.<br>
2015 Started fertilizing F84, contract, manually with GPS<br>
2017 Finished fertilizing F84, contract, collected contract reward 5.4k.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time acceleration until next fertilizing contracts appear.
</p>

<p>
2027 Accepted contract for fertilizing F84<br>
2028 Started fertilizing F84, contract, manually with GPS<br>
2029 Finished fertilizing F84, contract, collected contract reward 5.4k.
</p>

<p>
2043 Accepted contract for fertilizing F78<br>
2100 Started fertilizing F78, contract, courseplay ETA 29min, 2x tools<br>
2126 Finished fertilizing F78, contract, collected contract reward 163.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.335m
</p>

<p>
2139 Accepted contract for fertilizing F81<br>
2146 Took a short break...<br>
2212 Break is over, back to contracts
</p>

<p>
Going to try farmer_schubi's liquid fertilizer and fertilizer factories. On the original Start From Zero savegame I gave up on those as they are such a grind, but as I need to add some sort of factory production thing into PMC Grande Gardens 16km its good to refresh my memory how these factories work and how it feels to work with them.
</p>

<p>
So I saved game, exited and brought in farmer_schubi factory mods. Also removed few mods I'm surely not going to use in this savegame, speeds up savegame loading.
</p>

<p>
2232 Started fertilizing F81, contract, courseplay ETA 50min, 2x tools<br>
2242 Bought land with F92 in it for 108.1k<br>
2245 Purchased farmer_schubi fertilizer and liquid fertilizer factories (something like 225k + 125k I recall)<br>
2246 Purchased trailer tipper 70k liters<br>
2247 Purchased liquid tanker trailer and lizard hulk truck<br>
2320 Finished fertilizing F81, contract, collected contract reward 309.4k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 903k after all those factory and accessories purchases.
</p>

<p>
2346 Lunch break...<br>
<b>2021-03-08T0010</b> Feeding done, back to manure
</p>

<p>
0018 Accepted contract for fertilizing F68<br>
0037 Started fertilizing F68, contract, courseplay ETA 17min, 2x tools<br>
0053 Finished fertilizing F68, contract, collected contract reward 95.2k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 972.6k and then it was time accelerating while waiting for more fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizer factories were running, hauled solid fertilizer to liquid fertilizer factory, overnight produced like crazy 400k liters of liquid fertilizer. This is way overkill the production hourly rate is just insane.
</p>

<p>
0111 Accepted contract for fertilizing F78<br>
0134 Started fertilizing F78, contract, courseplay ETA 29min, 2x tools<br>
0200 Finished fertilizing F78, contract, collected contract reward 163.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.121m heh, nice.
</p>

<p>
Drove liquid fertilizer tanker truck to F92 and filled up 60k liters of fertilizer. Then it was more time accelerating to get new contracts.
</p>

<p>
0241 Liquid fertilizer factory is full, 999.9k liters <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
07/late-summer in-game 0435hrs, yeah farmer_schubi's production hourly rate is way too high, it just shoots product out hehe
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: checked out lua script few days later, farmer_schubi's both solid and liquid fertilizer factories produces 100 liters PER MINUTE, so its 6000 liters per hour and 144,000 liters per day. Now that is insane, way too high value, whole factory production loses its meaning this is like using cheat money. With FS19 Seasons mod when you have to time accelerate skip several days between planting and harvest seasons, these factories produce crazy amounts of product. As seen here, how many days did I skip until it was 1 million liters and factory full.</i>
</p>

<p>
Now there is no point in filling up those factories with raw materials because 1 million liters of liquid fertilizer and 600k liters of solid fertilizer, that will last me for a lifetime. Well, at least one full seasons year bare minimum (it lasts more, for sure).
</p>

<p>
0250 Accepted contract for fertilizing F78 and F73<br>
0253 Started fertilizing F78, contract, courseplay ETA 29min, 2x tools<br>
0319 Finished fertilizing F78, contract, collected contract reward 163.1k.<br>
0333 Started fertilizing F73, contract, courseplay ETA 16min, 2x tools<br>
0350 Finished fertilizing F73, contract, collected contract reward 90.6k.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to call it a night, well for farming anyways. PMC Gaming computer cannot be used in working hours today and supposedly the next few days, so I'm going to switch into FS19 terrain editing mode again. Sure I can play outside working hours lets say if I wake up several hours before working hours begin there is plenty of time to farm then, but we'll see I'm expecting not to play for at least few days.
