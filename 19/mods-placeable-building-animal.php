	<h2>MW HOF Pack USA Edition</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by . From modDesc:
</p>

<p>
MW_PLACEABLE_HOF_USA.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: Absolutely huge american style building pack, feels like most of it is for animals but there are standard sheds, barns, workshops and grain silo bins as well. Amazing thing is that error log is free with this amount of buildings. The only thing that caught my eye was that the icon images for the shop menus, were kind of ... "unprofessional" with logos and texts, also the names were underscored upper case so that looked a bit odd if not bad. Also the objects float a bit if the ground is not completely even underneath, for example the huge farm silo complex unloading grill was floating quite bad even though my terrain was pretty smooth.

	<h2>Small American Stable</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by CSA. From modDesc: Small American Stable
</p>

<p>
StableV2.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: Horse stable. Shamefully taken from CBJ Midwest Buildings pack 40x60shedWht.i3d, added bunch of horse related stuff and retextured. Even if permissions had been asked (which surely have not knowing farmsim community) it is still lame to just use someones existing building such way, if you cant create NEW content, dont bother mixing and matching other peoples stuff together like this.
