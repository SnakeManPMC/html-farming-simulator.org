<p>
Mods Placeable Building Grain for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Farm grain bins to store grain of all sorts. These can also be just a european style grain warehouse or shed buildings where small time farmers dump their low amounts of grain from harvests, the grain is indoors but its still very different method of storing it compared to regular grain bin. Generic Giants farm grain bins have the dumping grate on the ground and above it a loading/filling pipe. Some authentic american grain bins are operated using auger pipes.

v1.0 by ccs101, GtX. From modDesc: An American style grain bin for corn, wheat, barley, canola, oat, soybean or sunflower.
</p>

<p>
Brock_Bin.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: capacity 471,428 liters. Silo will only accept one grain type at a time, up to the capacity of the bin. Auger pipe is required to unload and load grain to this bin silo. To see how much (if any at all) product is inside the bin, simply stand in front of the output auger and the info will appear in the F1 menu. Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.
</p>

<p>
This is somewhat grayish design "low and fat" bin silo, looks nice. Capacity is not the greatest, less than half a million liters which you can easily pull from one very large or two medium size fields in large real world data terrains. But I guess once a bin gets full, you continue dumping to the next one <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Westfield W130-71 by TrailerParkFarms works without any issues.

Great looking model and textures. Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.

<p>
Huge stainless steel (or aluminum how would I know) great looking farm bin silo. If you have yard space and your auger pipe is long enough, this is the big boy bin you want <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Westfield W130-71 by TrailerParkFarms works just barely with this farm bin silo, it requires careful positioning.

Narrow / thin medium height bin silo. Unloading pipe is high up so you can directly unload into semi truck trailer and similar height trailers. Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.
</p>

<p>
This farm bin silo is narrow / thin which kind of reminds me of torpedo shape, this is not a low big fat bin. 3d model and textures are okay, but when you take a closer look yeah you can tell its very low polygon model for sure (but its fine, does its job).
</p>

<p>
Westfield W130-71 by TrailerParkFarms works just fine with this bin silo.

<p>
Notes: capacity 75,398 liters. Looks like this is Randomsparks model/textures. So this is exactly the same as the larger farm bin silos from ccs101/gtx, except this is in real life used for fertilizer/seeds. For plain grain crop storing 75k liters is like two truck loads heh. Shows fill level in F1 menu when you approach it. Tested 2021-06-04 no errors.

Notes: SCS_BIG_SILO is a joke, 800k liters capacity and all kinds of garbage decorations like pallets and bicycle etc there and the SCS_HOCHSILO_A will not extended it as its just individual grain bin. The small grain bin is also in german language. Do not use these, there are other farm grain bins with proper capacities and features available.
