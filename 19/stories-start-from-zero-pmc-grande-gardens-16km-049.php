</p>

<p>
Took 140k liter truck load of seeds from farm bin silo, its almost empty now, brought the seeds into farm 2 (I think thats whats it labeled heh) by the F19 as I'm going to be doing some heady seeding in this area.
</p>

<p>
0438 Finished seeding soybeans F19
</p>

<p>
Night was falling again when I was getting ready to start seeding F31. It was 12/mid-summer in-game 2103hrs so 6000 time accelerated to 13/mid-summer 0613hrs.
</p>

<p>
0450 Started seeding soybeans F31, courseplay ETA 19min, 4x tools<br>
0511 Finished seeding soybeans F31<br>
0512 Started seeding soybeans F01, courseplay ETA 20min, 4x tools<br>
0535 Finished seeding soybeans F01. Started seeding soybeans F02, courseplay ETA 36min, 4x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
About 25% done I realized that F02 has already been done and I'm just wasting time seeding it now, so I stopped <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Third big bud again set off to a random direction on the second headland corner, sigh. This shit is hopeless...
</p>

<p>
0820 Finished seeding soybeans F21<br>
</p>

<p>
Ran out of seeds in farm 2 bin silo, only got 11.9k liters out of there. Seed hawks are fairly full now, but I need to go scavenging where can I find more seeds, hopefully I don't have to buy seed buy station just for few fields. I have to admit the demand for seeds caught me by surprise, I can't even think how many hundreds of thousands of liters seeds I've expended to these fields heh.
</p>

<p>
Obviously its all relative, imagine how many millions of liters crops you'll get from these insane amounts of fields we have seeded now.
</p>

<p>
0832 Game shutdown for a quick break and to inspect items.xml where I might have some seeds or grain for seed factory. But one thing lead to another and this break turned out to be end of gaming for today.
