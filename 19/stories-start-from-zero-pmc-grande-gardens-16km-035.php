	<h2>2019-11-16 FS19 Game Freezes</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-11-16T0236</b> New farming day has started, we continue F43 corn harvest!
</p>

<p>
0403 Finished harvesting corn F43
</p>

<p>
Took a quick lunch break here. Next is to switch back to NW vehicle fleet sector for those harvest ready corn fields. So I recorded courseplay course from F51 to Farm 1 using semi truck (fast), then sent other truck, auger wagon and combines behind it.
</p>

<p>
Used semi truck to put some barley into seed factory, then few loads of seeds from the factory to farm bin silo so that there is empty space in the factory to produce more seeds. Logistics baby, all about large scale farming.
</p>

<p>
Too bad PMC Farm Bin Large does not show fertilizer and seed in the crop market prices menu, wonder if that has something to do with the actual selling points not accepting it, hmm?
</p>

<p>
