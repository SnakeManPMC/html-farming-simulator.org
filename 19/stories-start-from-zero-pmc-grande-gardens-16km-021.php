	<h2>2019-11-01 Crazy 13 Hours Cultivating Field Work</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-11-01T1454</b> Aand back at PMC Gaming as I have nothing better to do, firing up FS19 and off to farm.
</p>

<p>
Was really fed up playing yesterday. Today did my monthly chores and then just realized that nothing interests me editing wise, so as I had nothing else to do... I falled back to what I know, farming heh.
</p>

<p>
First I'm gonna take Fendt 1050 with john deere 2623 plow and go fix the edges on several fields which has annoying red plow line.
</p>

<p>
1512 Plow fixed edge in F04 east side<br>
1516 Started fertilizing F33, courseplay ETA 1h 2min, 2x tools<br>
1527 Plow fixed edge in F25 south and east sides<br>
1531 Plow fixed edge in F29 south west side<br>
1535 Plow fixed edge in F28 east side<br>
1540 Started cultivating F04, courseplay ETA 13h 18min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Haha hilarious 13hrs field work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
F04 is about 880 hectares so its a big boy. Was considering splitting it to two maybe even four sections, but decided to go as is. Courseplay generated 43,691 waypoint course heh.
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km has about 5 fields of this size and then the monstrous biggest field in history. Interesting to see that courseplay did work on such field size, I have even seen over 50k waypoint courses but cant remember if this was back in FS17 hmm anyways.
</p>

<p>
This field work will not be finished today because I fall a sleep before this is done. Not only that but I get bored to DEATH if I'd sit here for 13hrs while big bud 450's are pulling john deere 2410 5 section cultivators around. But we will keep going and dunno most likely I watch some tv etc while this is running. Lets see how far we get today.
</p>

<p>
Oh and imagine once this field is seeded with canola, the amount of liters we get out of this will be insane <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1628 Finished fertilizing F33<br>
1705 Started ploughing F27, courseplay ETA 2h 32min<br>
1717 Started fertilizing F39, courseplay ETA 41min, 2x tools<br>
1812 Finished fertilizing F39<br>
1951 Finished ploughing F27
</p>

<p>
2037 Bored out of my mind, F04 cultivating course still has 8h 15min left heh, I'm going to watch tv and idle on the background <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2358 Started fertilizing F27, courseplay ETA 16min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-02T0015</b> Finished fertilizing F27<br>
