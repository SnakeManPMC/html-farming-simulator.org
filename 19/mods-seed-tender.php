<p>
Mods Seed-Tender for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Seed tender is a trailer of some sorts used to carry seeds to the fields where seeders/planters are working so that those implement pulling tractors don't have to travel back and forth to the farm yard or where ever seeds storage is located. Often times seed-tenders are small pickup-truck pulled trailers, they could even be a gooseneck trailers with seed/fertilizer pallets loaded onto them, or big semi-truck pulled trailers that hold several thousand liters. Also some older style american farms use dump trucks to haul seeds to the fields, while I wouldn't call such dump trucks as "seed tenders" technically, they do serve the same purpose.

Notes: 35,000 liters only, no point of using this as elmers haulmaster hauls whopping 70k liters. Well this is proper seed tender instead of auger wagon, so for realism sake this should be used.
