<p>
<b>2019-11-22 PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.4 Upgrade!</b>
</p>

<p>
1728 Was in-game with first intention to play a bit.
</p>

<p>
So this is what happened: I edited PMC Grande Gardens 16km for two straight days, got in huge number of improvements like seasons mask, trees, utility poles, buildings (player and cosmetic farms), train system updates including railroad depots capacity increase. I was super eager to get to test these edits, so I had to hehe.
</p>

<p>
Porting the savegame from terrain v0.1.3 to v0.1.4 was a nightmare, I had to basically remake items.xml line by line and also shuffle farmlands.xml through various steps in-game to get the correct IDs I needed. Porting a savegame is no joke thats for sure.
</p>

<p>
Then it was to port seasons v1.0.1.8 beta build 35 to v1.0.1.15 beta build 41 which was released just hours ago. Actually this one I somewhat skipped, I didn't bother to bring over my crop rotation stuff and just let seasons reset all my fields to harvested state as random crop type. It is my understanding or lack thereof that porting a seasons savegame 1:1 as is... probably is not possible.
</p>

<p>
The pesky vehicle running costs that were sucking my money dry slowly every night, I found the cause for that; it was midwest durus 18m header + header trailer and coolamon mother bin 100t which had dailyUpKeep property set in the config. I removed that property and no more nightly vehicle running costs. Because of this I decided to add money bulk sum of 100k as I have lost much more than that and currently my account was -50k so I literally needed money before soybean selling day.
</p>

<p>
I felt a little bit undecided if I should continue playing because I'm looking at complete set of fieldwork to get fields growing. Well obviously, fields don't just start to grow by themselves haha, well yes of course not but the point was that in real life gaming hours it would be absolutely ONE WEEK no less to get all these fields done. I mean F04 and F05 are over TWO THOUSAND HECTARES in total size, imagine cultivating that amount of field, yes it will take literally days just that alone. Plus then all the other stuff, corn fields need to be plowed, some fields lime spread and all the herbicide spraying and fertilizing, ooh my!
</p>

<p>
Anyways I was a little bit hesitant to begin such huge task just after I promised to take a break from FS19, hell this v0.1.4 test was meant to be just that, A TEST hehe... hmm but my lust for farming draws me in dangerously... uuh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
After giving this some thought I decided to time accelerate to the soybeans selling day, which seems to be also the first corn selling day too. I want to test the railroad system that where are the bottlenecks that can I even transport grain to sell using it, do I need to edit the terrain more.
</p>

<p>
Most likely this time accelerating means that this game-play is just testing, ie not real Start From Zero which will be saved as progress.
</p>

<p>
03/early-spring in-game 1340hrs corn went to high deman on selling point 1, decided to try out how the trains move the corn closer to that location and then rest with trucks.
</p>

<p>
Railroad Silo 4 has 2.672m liters of soybeans and 2.388m liters of corn.
</p>

<p>
1812 Started to load corn into SE train<br>

1903 Sold corn in selling point 1 for 116.2k + 116.2k<br>
1907 Got courseplay course recorded and working, now I'll let truck roll on while I drive another truck to help it out<br>

1929 Sold corn in selling point 1 for 116.1k + 116.1k
</p>

<p>
The price is falling. Hmm what kind of high demand is this? Corn price is now 1659, which still is great.
</p>

<p>
1931 Sold corn in selling point 1 for 116.1k + 116.1k<br>

<p>
That was the last corn load form railroad silo 1, now there is only 8k liters left which I put on one truck. Next is 7.591m liters in farm bin silos, I believe most are in farm 1 silo and then rest in farm 4(?). So I'm going to make a truck route to haul farm 1 corn to selling point 1.
</p>

<p>
It is a long haul, but I don't see how train usage would make it any shorter really, because I cannot fill the train from farm bin silo so I have to use trucks anyways, so might as well do the long haul.
</p>

<p>
Btw budget now 4.049m heh nice set from corn.
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo 1 had 6.839m liters of corn, nice haul, here we go.
</p>

2241 Corn is no longer high demand in selling point 1, I was too slow hauling my millions of liters there hehe, oh well it was fun while it lasted
</p>

<p>
Budget now 9.928m and still 3.959m liters of corn in the farm bin silo 1.
</p>

<p>
2302 Started to load SE train from railroad silo 6, it has 1.484m liters of soybeans<br>
2312 Done loading<br>
2324 Started unloading to railroad silo 9<br>
2329 Finished unloading to railroad silo 9
</p>

<p>
Night was falling so time accelerated to morning daylight. 04/early-spring 0633hrs, it was raining. Well rain wont hurt us in the train haulin' business.
</p>

<p>
2343 Started to load SE train at railroad silo 9, soybeans<br>
2353 Finished loading soybeans from railroad silo 9<br>
2357 Started to unload SE train at railroad silo 1, soybeans
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-23T0003</b> Finished unloading SE train
</p>

<p>
0025 Started loading 1.215m liters of soybeans to SE train from railroad silo 7<br>
0035 Finished loading SE train<br>
0037 Started unloading SE train to railroad silo 9, soybeans
</p>

<p>
Now this train loading, driving and unloading starts to feel like quite tedious already...
</p>

<p>
0042 Finished unloading SE train<br>
0048 Started loading soybeans to SW train from railroad silo 9<br>
0054 Finished loading SW train
</p>

<p>
Then I realized that this is just my train logistics enthusiasm speaking that there is no reason for me to haul these crops from silo to silo because I don't know which selling point these are eventually going. Sure best bet is to consolidate the grain into the central hub railroad silo 1 where it can be quickly picked up by NW, NE and SW trains.
</p>

<p>
0059 Started to unload SE train to railroad silo 1<br>
0103 Finished unloading SE train
</p>

<p>
And here its time for me to call it a night, dead tired.
</p>
