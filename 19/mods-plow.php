	<h1>Mods Plow Farming Simulator 19 - PMC Farming</h1>

<p>
Mods Plow for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Also known as digger, ripper, moldboard plow, etc. There are many names which american field work implements are called. While Giants Software features "ploughing" in farmsim games with the distinct red map color, it doesn't really represent how american farming works (hardly anyone moldboard plows in america on 2020s). Regardless of european or american you generally speaking "rip the ground" after root crops harvest, like corn for example. This means plowing, or digging or dipping whatever terminology you want to use for the farmsim map RED color field state. If you only do regular crop types like barley, canola, soybeans, wheat etc then you never have to plow (red map color) in farmsim games. For authentic american farming one way of playing farmsim games is to simply disable ploughing all together and use whatever realistic field work implement like cultivator etc to work the ground after corn/soybeans etc harvests.
