<h2>Ravenport Felsbrunn Game Mode Review</h2>

<p>
Game mode placeable objects review to check which objects disappear and which not. Also quick overview of starting equipment. Important thing is to check P -> garage, what you got.
</p>

<p>
Career start describes how the game modes work. New farmer has vehicles, land, a lot of money and easy difficulty. Farm manager has no vehicles, no land, a lot of money and medium difficulty. Start from scratch has no vehicles, no land, little money and hard difficulty.
</p>

<p>
mapUS and mapDE are identical except mapDE new farmer wont offer tutorial:
</p>
<ul>
<li>new farmer SP; offers newbie tutorial at start. vehicles. farm silo + decorative objects. two pieces of land. 100k money, no loan</li>
<li>farm manager SP; no vehicles. no buildings. no land. 1 million money, 250k loan</li>
<li>start from scratch SP; no vehicles. no buildings. no land. 500k money, no loan</li>
<li>new farmer MP; there is no such thing!</li>
<li>farm manager MP; no vehicles. no buildings. no land. 1 million money, 250k loan. each farm created gets the same settings, ie money</li>
<li>start from scratch MP; no vehicles. no buildings. no land. 500k money, no loan. each farm created gets the same settings, ie money</li>
</ul>

<p>
mapUS/mapDE on different game modes did not seem to change object wise other than players farm. it looked the same everywhere except players starting location.
</p>

<p>
Hmm are the different game modes exactly the same because you can configure the difficulty levels from game settings menu. Obviously starting money/loan, placeables and vehicles are different, but the game modes are not the same kind of different as in FS17 where hard was actually hard without ability to change economy.
