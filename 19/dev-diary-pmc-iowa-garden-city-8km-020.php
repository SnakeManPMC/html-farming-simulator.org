	<h2>2021-05-29 GIMP Painting Gravel Farm Yard Driveways</h2>

<p>
2021-05-29T16:44:00Z New editing day has started, going to GIMP paint those farm yard driveway dirt/gravel roads a bit now. Not feeling overly enthusiastic about it, but lets try and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
2021-05-29T16:57:00Z Northern most row of US NAIP image painted with RGB 255,0,0 red dirt/gravel roads now. There was already few of them done previously in far NW corner, but basically all the rest remain untouched.
</p>

<p>
2021-05-30T01:09:00Z Was GIMP painting dirt/gravel driveway roads, didn't zoom out so don't know how much is done other than two road grids east-west alignment.
</p>

<p>
2021-05-30T02:18:00Z Done painting the driveway parts! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
There is still few touchups I need to do on intersections, here is couple of examples:

<p>
Also looks like many of the wind turbine paths are missing:

<p>
Then started to do this touchup pass. Better get it done right away so road painting is completely done and I can move into other tasks.
</p>

<p>
2021-05-30T02:44:00Z And all intersection and wind turbine touchups done, now GIMP road painting is 100% complete, if anything was missed then that falls to bugs category <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-05-30T03:56:00Z Compiled PMC_Iowa_Garden_City_8km_v1.1.5.7z for internal testers.
</p>

<p>
Asphalt roads are pretty rough at few places in this first iteration but those will be tweaked later.
