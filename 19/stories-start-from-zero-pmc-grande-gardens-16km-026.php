	<h2>2019-11-06 Huge Terrain And Massive Logistic Operations</h2>

<p>
1820 New farming day has started, FS19 is up, time to prepare for the big harvests.
</p>

<p>
1826 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F29, it only had three patches of weeds<br>
1831 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F24<br>
1839 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F04, yes... one more time, wonder if this will be the last?<br>
1845 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F33<br>
1846 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F38<br>
1850 Cherry picked herbicide spraying for F37
</p>

<p>
And again all weeds have been sprayed from the fields that are growing crops currently (other fallow fields do have weeds but they do not concern me).
</p>

<p>
In this round of spraying I did not see one single patch of flowery weeds, they were all young green plants which could not be spotted from the growing canola/corn/soybean greenery. Again why pre-emptive blanket weed spraying is the way to go.
</p>

<p>
05/early-summer in-game 0642hrs, more weeds popped up on F04, F24 and F29... yeah I give up, let them grow I'm done with this whack-a-mole mickey mouse game of chasing weeds, next year its all blanket spraying with dedicated herbicide sprayer equipment.
</p>

<p>
In-game 1142hrs barley is on high demand in selling point 10. I'm going to take the NW train, load it up with barley and transfer it as close to selling point as currently possible, then using trucks go sell several loads of it (but I leave some for seed factory). This is my first time using trains in PMC terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Looks like with PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 I can use the NW train tracks to pickup grain from railroad silo 4, dump it on railroad silo 1 which is the main hub (kinda, for now), then use NE train to pick it up from railroad silo 1 and dump to railroad silo 5 which is literally on top of selling point 10 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1906 Started loading the NW train in railroad silo 4<br>
1907 First car loaded with 143k liters of barley, whee my first train use in PMC terrain! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
THIS is what I've been waiting for in FS19, huge terrain and massive logistic operations just like in FS17 Cornbelt using trains, except just... <b>BIGGER</b> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I mean this really felt like magical loading my first ever PMC terrain massive grain train car setup in order the haul it logistics style to the other side of the terrain. It just... this is just so damn cool man! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1937 All 2.362m liters of barley loaded from railroad silo 4<br>
1949 Unfortunately v0.1.3 was bugged and I could not overload / dump into railroad silo 3 from the train<br>
2001 Uh oh same goes for railroad silo 1 and 4 as well
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km v0.1.3 is bugged, NW train cannot unload/dump at any of the connected railroad silos, damnit. I need to fix that but... for this seasons savegame in middle of the season with all my hard work seeding and caring those fields... I need to do some XML editing magic and transfer the grain into my farm bin silo which would otherwise be cheating but the terrain is bugged I tried to play normally but I cannot, its not my fault (as a player) so yes I'm going to savegame XML edit fix this.
</p>

<p>
First I removed all the 2.362m liters of barley from the train vehicles.xml, then I added 1.0m liters directly to the farmer_schubi's seed factory. Then I put 181,055 liters into farm bin silo. And finally I put 1.181m liters to railroad silo 5 which is next to selling point 10.
</p>

<p>
2114 Back in-game after editing XML for barley train bug, in truck heading to railroad silo 5<br>
2124 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2128 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k
</p>

<p>
Soybeans went on high demand on selling point 2 for 4,586 ! wow that is some big money! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2133 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2139 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2142 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2147 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2152 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2156 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 75.9k + 75.9k<br>
2200 Sold barley to selling point 10 for 66.2k
</p>

<p>
That was all the barley I wanted to sell, budget now 3.167m. Exited the game for some planning on the soybean selling.
</p>

<p>
Edited items.xml and magically moved the soybeans from railroad silo 4 to railroad silo 10. Then drove truck from F26 down to railroad silo 10.
</p>

<p>
2236 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322k + 322k<br>
2243 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322k + 322k<br>
2250 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322.2k + 322.2k, market price 4604 now<br>
2257 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322.2k + 322.2k<br>
2305 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322.2k + 322.2k<br>
2308 Loading up the last of the soybeans, almost a full load, 137.8k liters<br>
2312 Sold soybeans in selling point 2 for 322.2k + 312.4k
</p>

<p>
All the soybeans have been sold with special high demand market price (4604 in the end), budget now 7.023m <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2314 Its time for me to take a quick break...
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-11-07T0037</b> Back in FS19, how about some harvesting...
</p>

<p>
Just driving the trucks back from the railroad silos, both basically in the opposite ends of the terrain heh. But then I'm pretty much ready for some harvesting action so hopefully with time acceleration first field is ready soon (and not too much combine driving to that field).
</p>

<p>
07/early-summer in-game 0623hrs, few more weeds have popped up but I wont be bothered with those. Soybean market price 3705.
</p>

<p>
08/early-summer in-game 0618hrs, soybean market price 3841. Today with annual statistics is the seasons second best soybean selling day.
</p>

<p>
09/mid-summer in-game 0556hrs, soybean market price 3806. Today with annual statistics is the seasons best soybean selling day, which oddly at least in the morning now is less than yesterday. I guess the seasons market price fluctuations arent exact science in that sense. Not that less than 40 would be a big difference in grand scheme of things, but obviously you want to squeeze every last bit out of it, especially when you reach millions of liters volume.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-summer in-game 0050hrs yep that was the day, now soybeans market price is dropping again. And F04 and F38 are ready to harvest, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
0120 Exited from Start From Zero, started new career with pickup truck and going to record courseplay outline for 4 corners of F04 so its more manageable to harvest.<br>
0158 Done, courses saved and now I'm ready to harvest.
</p>

<p>
0217 Courseplay caused some sort of bug, had to kill FS19 task, decided to revert to the last stable courseplay version.
</p>

<p>
Ready to start harvesting canola on F04 but crops are too wet, so time acceleration while they dry up.
</p>

<p>
0245 Time accelerated to in-game 1709hrs and it just started to rain again hehe<br>
</p>

<p>
0247 Started harvesting canola F04 SE, courseplay ETA 3h 10min, 4x tools<br>
0624 Time to call it a night, have some chores to do before bedtime.
</p>
