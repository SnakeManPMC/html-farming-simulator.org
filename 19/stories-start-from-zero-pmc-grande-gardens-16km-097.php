	<h2>2021-01-07 Soybeans Harvest</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-01-07T0000</b> New day at the Gardens, this savegame now has 882hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
That's no joke, is 0000hrs as I'm typing this paragraph heh. Okay todays plan is to just harvest the next field towards south. There is a big gap between F50 which I just did yesterday and F78 and F77 which will be the next two fields to harvest.
</p>

<p>
So first I'm starting by relocating harvest fleet to F78, then to refuel everyone just to make sure we dont run out of fuel in middle of harvest, I just hate when inspector text shows status with fuel low text, so always keep guys topped up.
</p>

<p>
Got everything refueled and combine courseplay field work generated.
</p>

<p>
0104 Started harvesting soybeans F78, courseplay ETA 1h 25min, 4x tools.
</p>

<p>
When first semi truck load of grain reached railroad silo 7 it just ran right through it, there was no trigger, yikes. So I decided to make a new grain truck route directly to selling point 7. I mean... why not. Except while recording it I realized its railroad selling point hehe.
</p>

<p>
0301 Finished harvesting soybeans F78
</p>

<p>
Unloaded combines, grain carts and trucks in order to get ready to harvest corn next. Then... I got hungry.
</p>

<p>
0316 Lunch break...<br>
0345 Feeding time is over, lets start corn harvest<br>
0348 Started harvesting corn F77, courseplay ETA 1h 12min, 4x tools.<br>
0558 Finished harvesting corn F77
</p>

<p>
Another field harvested, aaah, feels great <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was very nice to harvest two fields in a day especially as this was a late night game-play session for me.
</p>

<p>
0617 Still no exactly tired but decided to call it a night.
</p>
