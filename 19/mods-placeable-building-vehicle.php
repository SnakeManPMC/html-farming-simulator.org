	<h1>Mods Placeable Building Vehicle Farming Simulator 19 - PMC Farming</h1>

<p>
Mods Placeable Building Vehicle for Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) by PMC. Traditional vehicle sheds. Also known as vehicle shelters, carages, vehicle buildings etc. It is simply a building where you store all your vehicles so they don't have to sit in the gorching sunshine, heavy rain or freezing snow in the winter months. Vehicles and implements need to be protected from the environmental elements. Of course parking vehicles and equipment into a vehicle shed has no functionality in any of the farmsim games, its purely cosmetic or "role playing", you can park your vehicles and equipment anywhere you want without any game-play penalties. Note that parking extremely large tractors, combines and implements is difficult as you need a really large vehicle shed and even so you might be limited with 2-4 vehicles max per building. For example big Bourgault and Vaderstad Seed Hawk air drills require huge door to fit through.

	<h2>CBJ Midwest Buildings Pack</h2>

<p>
v1.1 by CBJ. From modDesc:
</p>

<p>
FS19_PlaceableCBJbuildings.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: These are the CBJ Midwest Buildings from FS17 converted to FS19 and made into placeables. All have working doors using the open/close gate function. Lights come on at 1930hrs automatically. Cant see any errors, the texture quality is a bit low and door animations have no sound, but other than that its a solid american style building pack.

<p>

v by . From modDesc:

<p>
FS19_AmericanShedPack.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: basically the good old pack got into giants modhub. this is renamed file name so its not compatible with the existing mod I've used for years. have at least better preview images with the background removed. otherwise they looked exactly the same. very odd FS19_PlaceableCBJbuildings/ sub directory within the mod itself. doors have sounds added, otherwise the models look the same. animated light switch added. when looked further out they even have the same wooden planks from inside the building flickering, not sure if this is Z-fighting gaming wise or some giants engine thing, I mean those planks arent transparent textures heh. and whats worst... clip distance is atrociously low, buildings disappear at same distance as other stuff in felsbrunn where I tested these (didn't have PMC Farm Lab in the dir). yep, no thanks.

<p>
Notes: Small vehicle shed. Used also in nebraska lands. I don't like this as you cannot fit large equipment inside and even normal sized tractors is very cumbersome to fit through the doors and then turn sharply to backside of the shed.
