1419 Back at PMC Gaming, soybeans seeding continues. Lets put those bourgault hoe drills to work.
</p>

<p>
This F28 seeding was a bit messy, first started to single seeder driving manually using GPS because it felt cool, but guess my bearings got a bit lost with that monstrosity 1480ha field that this 100ha field felt like nothing... but its not nothing, it will take a long time to seed even with 30.5m single vehicle <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1452 Finished seeding soybeans F28<br>
1458 Started seeding soybeans F83, GPS<br>
1504 Finished seeding soybeans F83<br>
1505 Started seeding soybeans F84, GPS<br>
1512 Finished seeding soybeans F84<br>
1542 Started seeding soybeans F05, courseplay ETA 5h 58min, 4x tools<br>
2327 Finished seeding soybeans F05
</p>

<p>
Was watching SinisterSockz twitch streaming North Dakota Regent terrain editing so wanted to concentrate watching on that a while, also I don't really want to continue seeding more fields because the harvest gets so long then and running the risk again to not be able to finish before winter.
