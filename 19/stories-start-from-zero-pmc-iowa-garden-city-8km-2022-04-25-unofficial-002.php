	<h2>2022-04-26 Driving Tractors And Making Money</h2>

<p>
2022-04-26T09:50:48Z New farming day has started, lets drive some tractors and make some money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 9hrs 43min on it.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday when I created this savegame I saw a mod in the dir called <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=208186" target="_blank">"Sell Price Trigger"</a>, only have faint recollection what it did, its tracking crop market prices, records their highest numbers and alerts with in-game GUI notification when price exceeds previous record or something like this. This mod is awesome, I want to learn today what hotkey brings up the menu as I recall there being one to configure the prices what to watch etc. So I need to google this mod and any instructions for it, I might even have my own notes written down somewhere in PMC local notes.
</p>

<p>
Well my local notes had no info about this mod, but they could be in my "localhost" website(s) and to access those I need to switch back to editing computer so yeah going to just google, well that finds it easily, its actual giants modhub mod.
</p>

<p>
ALT-O opens the menu, this shortcut was actually listed in F1 help menu. There you can reset or set highest market price to watch for, then notification appears in GUI when this price has been exceeded, gotta love this mod, sell no crops without it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I put corn and soybeans there now.
</p>

<p>
Alright lets get going, goooood mooorning iioooowa gaaaarden ciiityyy! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
03/late-summer in-game 0756hrs, weather +15C/+18C and budget now 264.9k.
</p>

<p>
Things are looking good in iowa today <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay lets start scanning contracts list and see what can we do first <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well tons of cultivating and several seeding contracts, it would be nice if I had the patience to go through the endless hours of opening up those fields by doing these contracts, but I could probably spend this whole day just doing cultivating contracts. Even if I spammed them to the max using courseplay, it could still take most of the day if not more.
</p>

<p>
Seeding contract for F215 borrows case quadtrac with seed hawk, now if I were to get that and then do other smaller field contracts on the side... that would open nice fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
Hmm or I could do few more cultivating contracts around the dealership area to open more fields, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Dunno. Its funny, you want to play, enjoy, all the good stuff... but you really don't want to do 4hrs cultivating session by driving manually, that is one kind of torture for sure. If I follow old school Start From Zero rules then I cannot use Courseplay or GPS until I own a vehicle. <i>Edit: aaand??? Heh you dumb fool, <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=22739" target="_blank">Start From Zero - Getting Started and Rules</a> clearly states that before using automated tools you must own LAND and VEHICLE(s)!</i> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm speaking of vehicles, what if I would buy small tractor, bredal spreader and perhaps even small seeder, hmm, are there any seeder which doesn't cost arm and a leg but still can do somewhat doable seeding times. I think pronto 9dc or whatever it was is pretty decent speed and seed tank capacity but that requires I think close to 300hp or something, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Guess mainly the problem is that there are so few fertilizing contracts as AI is lazy as heck doing those contracts by himself, its now been (in-game) DAYS probably YEARS already and still the same cultivating contracts are waiting there, it feels like the AI has no clue how real life works heh.
</p>

<p>
Smaller bredal spreader with extensions cost 47.7k, dunno if there are specific horsepower requirement for such implement, I bet some medium size small tractor would do just fine, hmm what was it that I used the last time on Start From Zero, need to look it up ...
</p>

<p>
Oh this reminds me, I need to write down a extremely short summary of basic Start From Zero equipment progress, like which vehicles to buy first, what they cost etc. Right now I just cannot remember what is the good progress path, medium size small tractor and small bredal spreader is a good overall choice, sure, but yeah I would like a confirmation and more details.
</p>

<p>
Alright found this in <a href="stories.php">unofficial start from zero iowa garden city</a> story:
</p>

<p>
<i>"- john deere 6155m with gps<br>
- spreader bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit<br>
Leased above setup for 3.8k and 7.2k initial costs"</i>
</p>

<p>
Hmm okay so my first act was a lease in that story, but I seem to have not followed the old school rules because I leased stuff so I can use GPS and did just that, you are not allowed to use couseplay or GPS until you OWN the vehicles. <i>Edit: and land for petes sake!</i>
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong its all about having fun, sure, but those were the rules, maybe I should re-read the story which got all these stories started, the one and the only <a href="../17/stories.php" target="_blank">FS17 Cornbelt Start From Scratch</a>, heh yep the first story used scratch terminology <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
A bit later in the unofficial story I purchased the above setup for my first very own vehicle.
</p>

<p>
Seems like in that story I am getting much more fertilizing contracts just by time accelerating, now this stuff most certainly is frozen in time, nothing is happening by the AI. Hmm wonder why that is, could it be that FS19 v1.7.1 and current mod-set is causing some desync issues. Hmm maybe I need to try time accelerating few days just with the 5000 speed which I believe is the official giants farmhouse sleep speed. Or maybe using some much slower speed when going through the whole 24hrs day, dunno. I kind of find it hard to believe something would get desync as seasons has the dialog after all long time accelerations. But its worth to try.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to do that. Lets make a longer base line comparison first, time accelerate few nights with the stock default 120 speed which is atrociously slow, but if that doesn't kick in any field changes, nothing will or that desync is not the issue.
</p>

<p>
This is most likely waste of time, but hey lets try everything first before starting those hours long manual driving cultivating and seeding contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Starting time accelerating with 120 speed.
</p>

<p>
Oh hell no, that is frigging slow... you'll die of boredom for sure hehe, it takes more time acceleration err time than to actually cultivate small field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yes that is, crazy, forget 120 speed its a no go, alright we go to the 5000 speed giants farmhouse sleep next. But ugh 7 and 8 normal time acceleration keys only go to 120 speed, then I had some mod activated which uses CTRL-KEYPAD-PLUS, it allows me to go to 3000 and 6000 speeds, so I chose 3000 speed and skipped rest of the day.
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 0649hrs, weather +12C/+15C, no field or contract changes.
</p>

<p>
02/mid-autumn in-game 0754hrs, weather +6C/+10C, F253 turned harvest ready, F01 got cultivated, no contract changes.
</p>

<p>
Hmm so yeah saying <i>"its frozen in time"</i> is not entirely true... yes there are SOME changes but it takes literally in-game YEARS to happen, so lack of better terms yeah it is frozen in time, its the same end result. Only way to get some action is to do cultivating and seeding contracts to open fields up. I actually start to remember this stuff now, I must have written some notes about it, possibly on the other Start From Zero stories or my local notes, if I would just find them.
</p>

<p>
In <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org/19/stories-from-zero-iowa-garden-city-unofficial.php" target="_blank">2021-02-18 Stories PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Unofficial Start From Zero</a> I'm writing quote: <i>"Once you finish cultivating contracts it opens fertilizing and seeding contracts."</i>. And in <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.org/19/stories-from-zero-iowa-garden-city-unofficial-better-contracts.php" target="_blank">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Start From Zero Unofficial Better Contracts</a> I'm saying quote: <i>"do few cultivating contracts to open up more fields to fertilizing contract use."</i>.
</p>

<p>
So yeah I'm refreshing my memory of the stuff I already know. There is no ways about it, do cultivating contracts to <i>"open fields up"</i> to seeding and fertilizing contracts. This time around it looks it doesn't open any fertilizing contracts as the order is 1 cultivate, 2 seed and 3 fertilize.
</p>

<p>
However I am still trying to go through this year using 3000 speed time acceleration to get some reference data if it might help on the AI lazy doing contracts issue.
</p>

<p>
03/late-autumn in-game 0815hrs, weather 0C/+3C, the fields I cultivated and seeded are now harvest ready and harvest contracts appeared to them.
</p>

<p>
I am kind of tempted to take those harvesting contracts, just for a change of pace <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm yeah nevermind the 3000 speed time accelerating, I'm taking harvest contract <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T10:58:15Z Accepted contract for harvesting F153, with borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Then accepted all the other harvest contracts. Now just need to be careful not to do F153 and accept it which would return the vehicles, also to keep track which fields crop needs to be delivered to which selling point. One field at the time, nice and easy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was going to start harvesting, but forgot completely, its FS19 seasons, in the morning soil/crops are wet so cannot harvest. Alright time accelerating 120 speed nice and easy until crops are dry...
</p>

<p>
While I was time accelerating and waiting (not really waiting, but), continued watching Farmhand mike real life farming videos again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
03/late-autumn in-game 1409hrs, weather +7C/+3C, crops are dry, harvest is a go! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T11:09:11Z Started harvesting F147, contract, manually. Delivery Whole Crops (between F189 and F190, SW area).
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1111.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1111.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T11:15:43Z Combine grain tank is full, time to bring out the grain cart tractor...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1117.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1117.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T11:32:45Z Finished harvesting F147, contract, just need to deliver to the selling point.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1134.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1134.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T11:40:29Z Arrived at Whole Crops selling point, now if I could just dump enough to complete the contract and then go sell into the best market price location heh. Checked market price display and Whole Crops is second best price right now, lets sell it all, make it simple.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I dumped the trailer load (didn't check how many liters) and the green notification said 52% completed for F151, huh what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh my, was there some bug that you cannot take several HARVEST contracts because it messes up the delivery counts? Hmm.
</p>

<p>
In contracts menu F147 says 84% complete which I just harvested, F151 says 11% complete. Hmm heh, what a mess <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well nothing else I can do other than head back to the combine and continue harvesting the next nearby field.
</p>

<p>
Here is the list of contract fields and selling points, where do I have to deliver:
</p>

<p>
F147, Whole Crops<br>
F148, Whole Crops<br>
F151, Whole Crops<br>
F153, Whole Crops<br>
F154, Whole Crops
</p>

<p>
Heh sorry I started to write that list expecting different selling delivery points but apparently they are all the same, I have to think that is a bug that it merges them together, so that you should never took multiple harvest contracts.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm going to continue harvesting and then when its all over we see what happens, some of the contracts surely get completed, but dunno...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T11:57:08Z Started harvesting F148, contract, manually.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T12:24:15Z Grain trailer is full 45k liters. Heading off to the delivery selling point.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T12:30:33Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload.
</p>

<p>
Was unloading and before it finished it said 100% transported for F151 and after unloading was complete it said 11% transported for F154. So yeah folks, don't ever take several harvesting contracts, they do not work.
</p>

<p>
In the contracts menu currently F147 is 84% complete, F148 is 72%, F151 is 20%, F153 is 0% and F154 is 2%.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T12:46:28Z Finished harvesting F148, contract. Contracts menu says now 84% complete.
</p>

<p>
Had to take a quick break here, just restroom and Ukraine war news check break (I don't have news open in PMC Gaming computer).
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T13:08:00Z Started harvesting F151, contract, manually. This contract in the menu says now 20% even though I have not even made the first cut...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1323.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1323.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T13:36:52Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload. Stats for contract progress has changed a bit.
</p>

<p>
After unloading it said 71% transported for F154.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T13:46:00Z Lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T14:14:09Z Feeding time over, back to harvesting soybeans in F151.
</p>

<p>
While I was eating and thinking, this harvest contract decision might have been a big mistake, its already taken one quarter or section whatever of my day (between meals), which is a lot of time, usually 4+ hours. And I'm still doing it, almost feels like its no even half way done. On top of the time use... its not certain that these contracts complete and money is rewarded.
</p>

<p>
Hmm heh. Oh well only one way to find out, continue harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T14:42:08Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload. Checked out contracts menu and now it shows F151 complete, heh.
</p>

<p>
During unloading it said 100% transported for F15.. 1 I think, sorry didn't pay attention and after unloading it said 23% transported for F153.
</p>

<p>
03/late-autumn in-game 1745hrs, weather +7C/+3C, night starts to fall soon, I can already see the disgusting "FS19 glow" on the horizon on SW. Wonder if I get to harvest in darkness.
</p>

<p>
I didn't accept the completed contract for F151 as I still have plenty of harvest there.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T14:53:48Z Finished harvesting F151, contract, collected contract reward 13.9k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T14:56:14Z Started harvesting F154, contract, manually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1503.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1503.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T15:29:36Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload.
</p>

<p>
After unloading 68% transported to F153, hmm.
</p>

<p>
03/late-autumn in-game 1844hrs, weather +6C/+3C, dusk is upon us, now it started to get dark.
</p>

<p>
In-game 1859hrs had to turn vehicle lights on, ground gets so dark already. Its only matter of time until horizon turns to darkness.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:00:51Z After writing the above paragraph, its in-game 1900hrs and now soil/crops are wet, cannot harvest. Oh well, that solves our night time darkness issue then hehe, so time accelerating until morning daylight and then until crops are dry. I'm not going to do play-by-play times, I'll just say when crop is dry.
</p>

<p>
01/early-winter in-game 1518hrs, weather -1C/-4C, now it shows ground is frozen and when trying to harvest it says crops are wet. Hmm many youtube real life farmers like to harvest at night when ground is frozen so that daytime vehicles wont get stuck to melted ground. What I remember from FS19 seasons is that you can harvest in winter but hmm wonder why I cant now.
</p>

<p>
03/late-winter in-game 0925hrs, weather -9C/-9C, ground still frozen, cant harvest. Hmm so yeah wonder how badly this contract can be cheated, can I continue harvesting in spring? Haha.
</p>

<p>
02/mid-spring in-game 1110hrs, weather +10C/+5C, soil/crop is dry, lets harvest <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Extremely disappointing that I can time accelerate through winter without crops getting withered and can continue in the spring... cheating cheating <i>cheating</i> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But if this stuff would have died on me it would have been rage quit moment pretty much.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:13:33Z Got notification that contract finished for F154 even though I'm still harvesting hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:16:25Z Finished harvesting F154, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:17:30Z Started harvesting F153, contract, manually.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:30:21Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload.
</p>

<p>
During unloading notificaton came up for 100% transported for F153 and after 34% transported for F147. Uuh heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:32:10Z F154, collected contract reward 13.9k.
</p>

<p>
Forgot to mention started to harvest F153, last field, the one with borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T16:48:38Z At this point was, not exhausted or tired or bored, but felt that IF this big harvest contract set fails, even though I did manage to cash few of them in already, it would be quite bad for morale, maybe even rage quit moment. It has been a long day of harvesting. If I knew how long this will take I would have <i>never ever</i> taken all these harvest contracts. Guess my overall knowledge was a bit rusty on these harvest contracts. Well lessons learned, wont be doing this ever again.
</p>

<p>
Also these stories have been quite short/dry, mainly because I'm driving WITHOUT GPS and have not much time to type, for example this typing was done by setting combine to 270 degree heading and quickly ALT-TABbing here to type and then quickly back so the combine wont veer off course. Once you get GPS you got a little bit more time to type, depending on field size, but its only after Courseplay comes into play when you really get those usually hours lasting boredom moments when the <b>legendary PMC stories</b> come out <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:06:10Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload.
</p>

<p>
During unloading F147 contract finished, boom. Then after done it shows 48% transported for F148.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:07:21Z F147, collected contract reward 7k.
</p>

<p>
Not sure what it is in today, but it feels like extremely long day and funniest thing is that I still have almost half a day left (7hrs now). Very weird, most days I feel almost depressed when eating days last meal that heck do I have to go sleep in about 4hrs already, days go by too fast, but not today, haven't felt like this in a long time. Could it be this one long harvest which doesn't feel boring, but subconsiously... is? Hmm who knows <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:41:14Z Arrived at Whole Crops, ready to unload.
</p>

<p>
Contract F148 finished and then I started to receive money for my own pocked, got 72k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:42:13Z F148, collected contract reward 10.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:49:49Z Was harvesting and got notification that F153 contract completed, good. I'll keep harvesting.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1751.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2022-04-26T1751.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-26T17:54:20Z Finished harvesting F153, contract. Now just have to haul the grain to Whole Crops sell delivery point.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T18:04:00Z Here we are at Whole Crops, last unload going. Got 41k harvest income.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-26T18:04:58Z F153, collected contract reward 16.4k. And this returned the vehicles. Harvest contracts are over.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 440.9k, quite nice.
</p>

<p>
Today I started harvesting 1058hrs and now its 1804hrs when I finished, that is quite few hours of harvesting, no wonder it felt like forever.
