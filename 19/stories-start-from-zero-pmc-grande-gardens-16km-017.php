	<h2>2019-10-28 Midwest Durus Loves Soybeans</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-10-28T0535</b> Started FS19 already some time ago but forgot to write it down heh, anyways back to farming, lets get these harvests done.<br>
0605 Finished harvesting soybeans F38
</p>

<p>
First field harvested with new Claas Lexion 8900 with Midwest Durus 18m header on it, I love it. Excellent combine setup <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Why did I harvest F33 with only two combines using 13.7m headers, I do not know... hehe. It is so much nicer with four and with these monster headers which cut half the field in one pass heh.
</p>

<p>
Now we have three corn header fields left.
</p>

<p>
Dumped last load of soybeans, got 837.8k liters total. Nice harvest from one field.
