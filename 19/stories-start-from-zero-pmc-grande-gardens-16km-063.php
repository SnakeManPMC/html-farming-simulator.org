Oh man it feels great to have this big field finally harvested! Already when I turned into the last row I was virtually cheering here hehe. Having put all this work into the field the feeling you get when the task is complete is just awesome.
</p>

<p>
Then recorded basic transport grain loop for trucks at F52, did not refuel vehicles as I was hoping combines have enough juice to do this field.

Recorded another courseplay course from F54 to railroad silo 6 for grain truck. Always need to setup grain truck first before setting off combines so you don't have to panic when first combine gets full.
