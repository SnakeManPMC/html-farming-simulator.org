	<h2>2021-04-30 PMC Grande Gardens v1.1.10 Upgrade</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-04-20T0953</b> Another harvest day has started. This savegame now has 995hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
1326 Shut down FS19, live streams were dead and I was bored...
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: 2024-01-29T11:00:00Z, obviously with only two lines on that days story I'm going to merge it with the next days story.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-04-30T1841</b> Back at PMC Gaming, lets harvest some canola. This savegame now has 999hrs in it! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-04-30T1840.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-04-30T1840.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
Upgraded courseplay to v6.03.058 which is the latest and introduces new course file formats, this is very scary that are there going to be any bugs. I took of course backups of savegame and courseplay courses, even copied them to editing computer as well.
</p>

<p>
Upgraded to PMC Grande Gardens v1.1.10 which is pretty cosmetic update to change selling point and railroad silo map label names to "SP" and "RS" style, some other changes too which I can recall now.
</p>

<p>
Had some issue with courseplay settings, when I used the general menu scan fields automatically it froze FS19 for a long time, usually I just task manager kill the task and try again, but this time I decided to wait. I remember from long time ago that F40 or some other big field in PMC Grande Gardens 16km takes really long time to scan, the thing is I cant recall if it was 10min or something ridiculous like half an hour. I wouldn't need to scan any fields, but it would be kind of nice to have courseplay settings turned on, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Also preparing to start a live stream, but first I'm getting this new courseplay version configured properly. No point streaming frozen screen heh. I'm hoping that today friday prime time UTC and very eary US east coast there might even be some viewers, all my recent streams has been extremely late UTC and somewhat late US east coast time. Overall my live streams have been almost without viewers recently, which is odd as back in 2020 when I streamed PMC Texas Rowena 8km my stream was in top-3 on FS19 category at peak moment (ie "middle of the night" hehe).
</p>

<p>
While waiting I searched this page through and sure enough there was several mentions of F40 scan freezing game for 15 minutes, so yeah guess I'll turn off the field scan after this. Its just something all courseplay players have to live with when using large terrains. Field scan option is convenience and causes no hassle when you have it disabled and scan fields manually when driving your vehicle to it. No big deal.
</p>

<p>
1915 Finally game fully loaded and we are ready to continue harvesting

2347 Time to call it a night, ended live stream on 4h 28min mark
</p>

<p>
Took a break to cook and eat a nice meal. I was ready to call it a night as seen above... but after the meal I felt great and wanted to continue farming. Not so much live streaming but just farming and listening to music and watching twitch/youtube etc.
</p>

<p>
When I loaded this savegame up it had <b>1003hrs</b> in it, wow one thousand hours in a single savegame, now that is badass <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">

0355 Finished harvesting canola F59
</p>

<p>
Across several days and several hours... I finally managed to finish F59 canola harvest <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Emptied all vehicles to railroad silo 9, not sure how much canola is in that bin silo now but our farm own total of 17.548 million liters <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
0417 All vehicles refueled, now we just time accelerate until corn and soybeans harvest season
</p>

<p>
Railroad silo 9 has liters of; wheat 1.686m, canola 9.236m, soybeans 5.747m, corn 2.507m, seeds 79k.
</p>

<p>
PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero with one THOUSAND hours of game-play has 30FPS performance when you load it up, it dips as low as 20FPS when four combines and two grain trucks are running under courseplay. I have theory that crops in farm bin silos could cause giants engine to lag, yes it sounds stupid but when you unload from auger wagon to a truck trailer there is performance drop during unloading, maybe this extends to the huge numbers of grain liters in our various bin silos.
</p>

<p>
Wanted to sell some grain to see if performance increases while its sold off, but we have so insane amounts of grain stored that it would take probably a full day of game-play to sell all of it, so that will have to be another day, now I want to get into harvest season.
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 0820hrs, alright now we are in corn and soybeans harvest season. Our crops are still growing. 02/early-autumn in-game 0840hrs, now soybeans are ready to harvest but corn is still growing. This means we will drive combines with midwest durus headers on into this field, harvest it and once we drive back to F56 SE we can change to corn headers.
</p>

<p>
0518 Transferred harvest fleet to F82 NW
</p>

<p>
Now I'm wondering should I try to do this whole field as single courseplay course or same way as last year when I ran out of time, in four sections. Hmm Hmm. It sounds better to do it in small pieces because on previous canola harvest driving back and forth with grain cart tractors got really tedious as that field was so long, same as F82.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of doing all four sections individually starting from NW section. Semi truck grain transport goes to railroad silo 8 which is just east of F82.
</p>

<p>
0529 Started harvesting soybeans F82 NW, courseplay ETA 2h 29min, 4x tools.
