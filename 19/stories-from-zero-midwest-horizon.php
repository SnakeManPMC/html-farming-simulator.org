	<h2>Midwest Horizon Start From Zero</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-04-30</b> This was my first time playing midwest horizon which was released already few days ago. I had just attempted to take a break from PMC Iowa Garden City 8km "start from zero" career only like a day ago, but now I'm back in FS19 heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Took an harvest contract for F104, 4.8ha. It pays 7.7k minus the borrowed vehicle prices, but it was the only one available and honestly I didn't feel like doing much larger field right from the start.
</p>

<p>
0620 started harvesting F104. Did courseplay course, really not in the mood to drive manually.<br>
0741 finished harvesting F104, still need to haul grain into silo to complete the contract.<br>
0748 unloaded trailer to horizon coop, contract finished and I got money from the grain, budget now 17,587 heh my first money ;)<br>
0801 sold remaining grain from the harvest for 4,200 then collected contract reward, 6,854 and budget now 28,642.<br>
0803 accepted fertilizing contract F48, 5.3ha. With borrowed vehicles.<br>
0811 started fertilizing F48, contract.<br>
0822 finished fertilizing F48<br>
0824 collected contract reward, 9,469 and budget now 32,352.<br>
0826 leased bredal k165 with extension and spreading discs for initial cost 3,876 and 1,596 per hour fee.<br>
0827 leased new holland t6 with narrow tires for initial cost 5,253 and 2,163 per hour fee.<br>
0829 accepted all fertilizing contracts there was.<br>
0836 started fertilizing F21, contract.<br>
0845 finished fertilizing F21, collected contract reward 11,071.<br>
0847 started fertilizing F90, contract.<br>
0852 finished fertilizing F90, collected contract reward 7,280.<br>
0854 started fertilizing F88, contract.<br>
0920 finished fertilizing F88, collected contract reward 7,331. Took a while as I helped Roozsta to test john deere 220 disc :)<br>
0925 started fertilizing F10, contract.<br>
0943 finished fertilizing F10, collected contract reward 21,848.<br>
0953 started fertilizing F53, contract.<br>
1012 finished fertilizing F53, collected contract reward 16,082.<br>
1015 started fertilizing F123, contract.<br>
1023 finished fertilizing F123, collected contract reward 9,460.<br>
1031 started fertilizing F118, contract.<br>
1100 finished fertilizing F118, collected contract reward 29,595.<br>
1108 returned leased fertilizing vehicles. Budget now 89,573 which is pretty nice but nowhere near where I could start to buy my own vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Finished this first test in Midwest Horizons, the few locations I saw looked nice. In this start from zero career made a bit money but nowhere near to start thinking about buying own vehicles, it was literally a first stab at it. More tomorrow, I think.
</p>

<p>
1827 Back at PMC Gaming, firing up FS19, time for some Midwest Horizons.
</p>

<p>
It was in-game time 1245hrs and only one very small reward fertilizing contract, so time to time accelerate and see what new contracts I get next. So time accelerated a bit then came night and fastnight mod took over and fast forwarded to 0700hrs the next morning. Still no fertilizer contracts, one appeared of 27k reward but its borderline not worth it as if I lease vehicle and do only this one contract it progresses me very little in this career, I need at least 5+ contracts stacked in order to make a real progress.
</p>

<p>
1856 Had a lunch break while game was running real time, no new contracts, well any that would pay me anything, those harvest and cultivating contracts are just waste of time when I don't have proper vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated in 2hrs increments until the next evening begun at in-game 1930hrs, I let fast night do its thing and then we were in 0700hrs in the morning. Contracts did not change much over night, few more cultivating ones got added, ugh. Then tried to even restart the game just to check if it would refresh the contracts somehow (like the leftover contracts on the list which disappear upon accept), but no dice, guess the contracts are saved in missions.xml file and no restart will change that.
</p>

<p>
More time acceleration and the next night was reached, fastnight did its thing. In-game morning still no fertilizer contracts, sigh, how long will this take heh. Time accelerated to in-game 1200hrs and still nothing.
</p>

<p>
2007 Had some IRC stuff in between here. Now lets continue farming. Time accelerated in-game 1606hrs and it started raining, still no fertilizing contracts, uuh.
</p>

<p>
I'm now again paranoid thinking that could the x600 time acceleration mess up the field stage changes somehow that they are skipped. I mean it shouldn't because I only hop forward in 2hrs increments, but yeah dunno. I know that if you used the crazy x9000 or whatever the one crazy fast forward mod did it caused the crop growth to halt / skip completely during the time acceleration.
</p>

<p>
2014 Time accelerated past in-game midnight again, next day is here, still no fertilizing contracts. There was some new seeding ones so contracts do seem to update with x600 time scale.<br>
2029 Time accelerated past in-game midnight, again for the how many times is this now and still no fertilizing contracts... man, the x600 must be skipping crop growth stages as its just not possible to have any fert contracts over like what three days period, that just doesn't happen. OK, I'm going back to x120 time scale.
</p>

<p>
After switching to x120 time scale I got first spraying contract in no time, so yeah must be that x600 being too fast for FS19 engine to handle regarding crop growth stage switching.
</p>

<p>
2034 In-game time 0820hrs first fertilizing contract appeared, finally! Yes x600 definitely is too fast for FS19 engine, I'll stop using it now, I've already known that you should not use such speeds unless just skipping through the night, not even then if you can avoid it.<br>
2036 Accepted two fertilizing contracts for F04 and F12. Leased another bredal k165 solid fertilizer spreader and tractor.<br>
2042 started fertilizing F04, contract.<br>
2106 finished fertilizing F04, collected contract reward 34,242.<br>
2108 started fertilizing F12, contract.<br>
2117 finished fertilizing F12, collected contract reward 15,898.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 125.9k and no fertilizing contracts in the menu, so I'm going to return the leased vehicles that they wont burn away all my money.
</p>

<p>
2128 After x120 time accelerating to in-game 1705hrs new fertilizing contract appeared, it was 30k so quite nice but I'd still want at least one more before I bother to lease vehicles again. Its not cheap leasing and still don't have enough to by my first own tractor + spreader.
</p>

<p>
Soon after got another fertilizing contract but it was lousy 2k reward so not worth my time. Then night time in-game arrived and I let fastnight do its thing on x300 time acceleration that hopefully is not too fast for FS19 engine. At in-game 0700hrs there was two new contracts but ironically overnight the 30k one had disappeared and the new ones didn't even sum up to that heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
I must say in this career there has been a lot of time acceleration going on.
</p>

<p>
2142 In-game 1633hrs got fertilizing contract for 30k, now I'm going to take it so I don't miss out once again. And when I ALT-TABbed back to game there was massive 127k reward one appeared as well, wow nice over one hundred and fifty grand worth of contracts, ayeah lets get to work :)<br>
2144 Leased another bredal k165 solid fertilizer spreader and tractor.<br>
2152 started fertilizing F64, contract.<br>
2212 finished fertilizing F64, collected contract reward 30,766.<br>
2224 started fertilizing F108, contract. Courseplay duration 1h 17min, heh.<br>
2344 finished fertilizing F108, collected contract reward 127,677. At the same time F64 fertilizing contract came available, again, odd? I'll take the 30k :)<br>
2350 started fertilizing F64, contract.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-01T0012</b> finished fertilizing F64, collected contract reward 30,766.
</p>

<p>
May 2019 started, whee ;)
</p>

<p>
When doing these last two fields I was already planning on how to start my farm, checked out the cheapest and most suitable land lots near the vehicle shop and crop sale point in SE corner. Vehicles are the problematic part as they cost so much when you count all of them and there is really no cheapo option to get in the start, I mean I'm done with the cheapest vehicles like 2m plows/seeders and 4m harvester headers, no thank you I want some capability on my vehicles. Yes yes I know this is what start from zero is all about, but I am not going to spend another six (6) hours harvesting with some piece of junk combine, been there done that and wasted the time that I'm never going to get back heh.
</p>

<p>
0021 Drove to vehicle shop, unloaded bredal and then returned the leased vehicles. Budget now 278.4k<br>
0044 Took one fertilizing contract, then in-game night time came, fastforward to 0700hrs and luckily the field was still not fertilized and I had the contract.
</p>

<pre>
- bredal k165 with extension and spreading discs 76k
- new holland t6 with engine upgrade 127k
===
203k
</pre>

<p>
0045 Purchased the above setup so I'm ready for some fertilizing contracts.<br>
0052 started fertilizing F83, contract. First time with my own vehicle ;)<br>
0106 finished fertilizing F83, collected contract reward 21,703. Budget now 81.8k<br>
0126 After some time acceleration one lousy fertilizing contract came along.<br>
0129 started fertilizing F88, contract.<br>
0136 finished fertilizing F88, collected contract reward 7,956. "whohoo.."<br>
0145 Got new fertilizing contract.<br>
0147 started fertilizing F30, contract.<br>
0214 finished fertilizing F30, collected contract reward 26,492.<br>
0217 After in-game midnight there was forecasted rain coming. Two new fertilizing contracts, not paying too much but I'll take them.<br>
0220 started fertilizing F43, contract.<br>
0225 finished fertilizing F43, collected contract reward 4,557.<br>

0434 started fertilizing F94, contract.<br>
0449 finished fertilizing F94, collected contract reward 22,548.<br>
0501 started fertilizing F75, contract.<br>
0521 finished fertilizing F75, collected contract reward 24,823.<br>
0535 started fertilizing F62, contract. Had to record field_edge course to this one as the field itself is not working in courseplay.<br>
0640 finished fertilizing F62, collected contract reward 81,318. Budget now 359k<br>
0643 started fertilizing F72, contract.<br>
0657 finished fertilizing F72, collected contract reward 13,872.<br>
0706 started fertilizing F21, contract.<br>
0715 finished fertilizing F21, collected contract reward 11,071.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 353.2k that is pretty nice amount of money, but unfortunately still not enough for even the most medicore starter vehicles where you don't have to suffer from the utterly useless vehicle performances anymore. I recall from my other start from zero career that it was more like well over half a million what you need to spend.
</p>

<p>
Dunno if leasing the good equipment for quick cultivating/seeding and then harvesting would be reasonable to get farm jump started.
</p>

<p>
0738 started fertilizing F81, contract.<br>
0810 finished fertilizing F81, collected contract reward 55,339.<br>
0832 Called it a night, was somewhat tired and again the game-play progress was in a kind of stalled state.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-06T0420</b> Long story short I deleted all my real world data terrains and was really disappointed / frustrated, I wanted to relax so thought about playing some FS19 and my only option with my terrains now being deleted is Midwest Horizons. So, lets continue.
</p>

<p>
Decided to get this career rolling and buying my first own field and minimum vehicles. I even considered taking out a loan which goes against the very core of what start from zero is about, but luckily at last minute decided against it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Fast forwarded through the night (x120 scale), then restarted FS19 to upgrade into new build of courseplay.
</p>

<p>
0753 Started harvesting canola F80. Courseplay duration 1h 24min, damn that 5m header heh.<br>
0901 Sold canola in cooper farms grain for ?k<br>

1336 Finished fertilizing F41, contract, collected contract reward 47.2k.
</p>

<p>
1337 Shut down FS19, pretty tired and wasn't into playing for today anymore.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-07T0027</b> Back at PMC Gaming, farming continues. Started fertilizing F28, contract.<br>
0029 Finished fertilizing F28, contract, collected contract reward 3.2k.<br>
0033 Started fertilizing F16, contract.<br>
0038 Finished fertilizing F16, contract, collected contract reward 6.2k.<br>
0039 Started fertilizing F12, contract.<br>
0048 Finished fertilizing F12, contract, collected contract reward 15.8k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 267.3k quite nice boost by doing these few fertilizing contracts. Now I could buy more land but first things first, F80 needs weed spraying so I'm going to buy my own cheapo spraying system.
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer tank kuhn pf 1500 1.5k liter 8k
- sprayer 12m kuhn deltis 1302 mta3 1.3k liter 30k
===
38k
</pre>

<p>
0054 Purchased the above sprayer setup.<br>
0057 Started spraying F80<br>
0115 Finished spraying F80<br>
0123 Canola was growing in F80 and all I could do is wait for harvest time, so time acceleration until we get there (or have more fertilizing contracts).<br>
</p>

<p>
BTW I installed gimp v2.10.10 back to PMC Gaming computer even though I want to keep PMC DevSurf editing separate from my gaming activities. Did this because running those long courseplay tasks is ideal time to ALT-TAB into gimp and edit some terrain files, like tonight I'm editing PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km cultivator_density image.
</p>

<p>
Also I need to take screenshots for this website of all my terrains FS19 in-game mapview screens for field numbers and states, plus some generic 3D landscape shots too, I cant do this as Gaming computer has no tool to even capture stuff (no I wont be using FS19 in-game screenshot key feature).
</p>

<p>
0213 In-game 1430hrs it started to rain. Looking at the field state the rain probably will be over by the time crop is ready for harvest.<br>
0230 In-game 2030hrs my canola was ready to harvest but it was still raining.<br>
0234 In-game 0327hrs rain stopped, lets harvest this canola shall we.<br>
0235 Started harvesting canola F80<br>
0246 As soon as I start harvesting two fertilizer contracts appear, how typical.<br>
0345 Grain trailer was full but price of canola is very poor 1730 and I have no farm silo to store my stuff.<br>
0347 Purchased small farm silo 100k liter placeable for 110k
</p>

<p>
Now that I got the first farm silo, I'm hoping this wont turn into endless wait for canola market price to increase, like what happened in my start from scratch FS17 cornbelt career where I waited literally days in real time for prices to increase heh.
</p>

<p>
0427 Finished harvesting canola F80<br>
0437 Started fertilizing F80<br>
0445 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
0447 Started seeding soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
Decided to seed soybeans so I wont run out of space in the tiny farm silo right away, especially if I have to do yet another harvest after this one.
</p>

<p>
0535 Finished seeding soybeans F80<br>
0536 Started fertilizing F80<br>
0544 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
0546 Took a small break to test out Hankinson, North Dakota 4km terrain.
</p>

<p>
1002 Well that break turned out to be a bit longer, joined someone else to play MP for few hours :)<br>
1003 Fired FS19 back up, lets continue farming, well err, in my own savegame in singleplayer heh.<br>
1008 Started fertilizing F02, contract.<br>
1014 Finished fertilizing F02, contract, collected contract reward 9.5k.<br>
1018 Started fertilizing F06, contract.<br>
1030 Finished fertilizing F06, contract, collected contract reward 17.5k.<br>
1034 Started fertilizing F07, contract.<br>
1048 Finished fertilizing F07, contract, collected contract reward 18.2k.<br>
1050 Started fertilizing F05, contract.<br>
1052 Finished fertilizing F05, contract, collected contract reward 5.2k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 160.7k so I could have bought one of the close by fields, but decided to do this harvest and then make new purchases. Hopefully by that time I already have some fertilizing contracts done as well.
</p>

<p>
1059 Started spraying F80<br>
1114 Finished spraying F80<br>
1140 Time accelerated until in-game 0540hrs when two things happened simultaneously; it started to rain and my soybean crop got ready to harvest haha<br>
1156 In-game time 1005hrs I noticed that market price for canola was 2458! whoa, lets go sell! heh<br>
1159 Sold canola in horizion coop for 76.1k<br>
1202 Sold canola in horizion coop for 73.1k<br>
1209 In-game 1724hrs it stopped raining, lets harvest some soybeans, yeah! Started harvesting soybeans F80. Courseplay duration 1h 25min.<br>
1340 Finished harvesting soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
This soybean harvest got me 47,721 liters where canola brought in 60k liters. Much nicer yield in canola and its at good day almost at same sale price so yeah definitely keep seeding canola for now. Soybean market price was 2361 in cooper farms grain, so I sent tractor grain trailer there to sell using courseplay.
</p>

<p>
1350 Sold soybeans in cooper farms grain for 73.1k<br>
1405 Sold soybeans in cooper farms grain for 39.4k<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 410.3k which is pretty nice amount indeed. The combine of mine is pretty bad with 5m header, the next step up would be John Deere T560 with 7.6m header but I think overall I need more fields as my fertilizing, spraying and even seeding capability is mostly fine.
</p>

<p>
1412 Started fertilizing F80<br>
1420 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
1424 Started seeding canola F80<br>
1513 Finished seeding canola F80<br>
1514 Started fertilizing F80<br>
1523 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
1532 Was dead tired so time to shut down FS19 and get some shut eye, hopefully get to have busy day tomorrow editing, playing MP and then continuing this Start From Zero career as well.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-08T0449</b> Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 fired up, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
Canola is growing, its in-game 2345hrs so lets time accelerate until something happens.

1004 Finished fertilizing F66, contract, collected contract reward 22.3k.<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 474.1k nice. I think its land purchasing time. Decided to purchase land lot which has F04 but right now its cultivated state so I'm going to play the market game and wait until its seeded, just hopefully its some good crop and not crap like potatoes or something which I wont touch. So time acceleration and waiting, in-game time now 1616hrs. Well in-game 1834hrs it got seeded, you guessed it, cotton. Sigh heh.
</p>

<p>
1041 Purchased land lot which has F04 for 358.4k<br>

<p>
Harvester upgrade is here. Hopefully with this 7.6m header we can manage to start make money more easier that F80 harvesting don't take 1h 25min anymore, also the new F04 is quite large which definitely take some time to knock out. Looking forward to this next harvest with my new combine.
</p>

<p>
1427 Started harvesting canola F80. Courseplay duration 56min, okay so shaved off just about half an hour of the harvest time, guess its okay start.<br>
1532 Finished harvesting canola F80.<br>
</p>

<p>
On this harvest got total of 61,498 liters canola out of F80.
</p>

<p>
1536 Started harvesting canola F04. Courseplay duration after headland and first row done 2h 15min (yeah forgot to check at start).<br>
1639 Sold canola in horizon coop for 61k, farm small silo was full so had to sell, I'm glad the price was pretty decent at least.<br>
1716 Sold canola in horizon coop for 62.1k<br>

</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-11T1208</b> Time to fire up midwest horizon and continue start from zero career :)
</p>

<p>
I decided that from tomorrow on I'll continue editing full time and leave playing as secondary only when I get so tired of editing for the current day that I want to relax a bit by playing. Basically what I want to do is to edit like one week straight 16hrs day full intensity (more details from <a href="pmc-terrains.php">PMC Terrains</a> page) and stop wasting time by playing.
</p>

<p>
This means that midwest horizon start from zero story will be on hold for unknown amount of time. My plan is to edit my own terrain to playable level, not sure which one it will be most likely PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km which in big picture was my first terrain (its complicated). I want to start career in my own terrain which will continue until end of times. Its always better feeling to play on your own terrain. Also in the early parts of development you are doing game-play testing.
</p>

<p>
So todays midwest horizon start from zero will be my last for now, but I will play until my eyes wont stay open anymore. Interesting to see how much progress I can make, not much in the big picture but still hopefully can buy new land or maybe upgrade my vehicle fleet a bit. We'll see.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Between 1400hrs and 1429hrs I had some chow, the last time I checked canola price was 2033 and increasing, after done eating at 1429hrs the price had plummeted to mere 1745... oh wow, how many thousands did I lose during chow... man that sucks. FS19 really has some stupid market price stuff, I had no time acceleration and nothing going on, just waited 29min and poof market price goes to dogs. Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
1431 Sold canola in horizon coop for 51.5k, budget now 406.5k<br>

<p>
Right after finishing F05 I shut down FS19, been up over 16hrs almost all of it playing so time to call it a night even though I'm not really tired yet. Tomorrow... well if I can stick to my plan there will be no playing, just editing. We'll see how it goes. So hopefully next entry to this midwest horizon start from zero story comes after a loong while :)
</p>

	<h2>After The Break</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-10-12</b> I got this urge to play some very small scale farming with seasons in ravenport. Yes I know ravenport haha the joke of the community but I just wanted something familiar and very small, I have savegames in all the megalodon PMC terrains but I was not so committed to FS19 playing that I would start to spend 4hrs+ on average field work.
</p>

<p>
Downloaded Midwest Horizon v1.1 <a href="http://www.modhub.us/farming-simulator-2019-mods/midwest-horizon-v1-1-0-0/" target="_blank">modhub.us</a> as I was thinking that even though it is 4km so not the tiny default size, its still very nice small detailed terrain where I might get that kind of moderate tiny feeling what I was looking for in ravenport.
</p>

<p>
Basically all I want to do is very very small scale farming very relaxed just for 5-10min quick fun to drive tractor around, the exact opposite what the 16km terrain monster 500ha field work is. If I'd want to dig really deep into FS19 I would be playing in my own extremely large terrains.
</p>

<p>
I feel midwest horizon is large compared to ravenport so not what I want (I want tiny small scale quick fun), but lets think of it this way that midwest horizon is not ravenport shit and I don't have to buy all the farmlands right away or not at all.
</p>

<p>
Really difficult to explain what I mean, I made a promise to never again play in ravenport after the initial seasons test, so continuing to play there would be lame but at the same time midwest horizon size wise is right there with PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km so its not any 5-10min quick fun game-play.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
My previous savegame4 is start from zero, without seasons as it was not released back then. Txzar wrote in v1.1 release that it requires new savegame. New savegame is fine but I need to definitely port over my vehicles, farmlands and money.
</p>

<p>
I was considering just deleting the start from zero and beginning a new "farm manager" mode career because I'm not sure if I want to play more than couple of minutes, hours or days.
</p>

<p>
Savegame porting for xml works: vehicles, farmland, farms and items. When you copy over environment it will fail, makes FS19 go nuts, it just doesn't work with seasons. Or perhaps you could first port the terrain only v1.0 to v1.1 savegame, only after that adding seasons porting to it, but oh well I already deleted the original environment so thats that.
</p>

<p>
Around 0605hrs started midwest horizon v1.1 with ported start from zero savegame to seasons. It was just the second field I started to work on, F04, which already gave me half an hour ETA on courseplay... THIS is what I wanted to avoid with very small scale quick fun farming... I wanted to have quick 5-10min fun, now I'm spending frigging half an hour on single field haha, oh well, thats darn farmsim for ya buddy ;)
</p>

<p>
0635 started to catch up on youtube farming videos by watching first welkers farm video I have not seen since I took a break from FS19. Man there is going to be hours of videos to watch now, oh well with FS19 courseplay running... I got nothing better to do haha ;)
</p>

<p>
0648 started to spread lime to F04, courseplay ETA 49min heh<br>
0733 done spreading lime to F04<br>
0735 started spreading lime to F05<br>
0743 finished spreading lime to F05<br>
0750 started fertilizing F05<br>
0757 finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
I must say midwest horizon doesn't give me that small scale tiny quick fun farming feeling same as ravenport, even these F04, F05 and F80 feels too large for such quick fun. Yes I know, ravenport is not proper hardcore farmsim stuff, but hey that is what I wanted so... yeah.
</p>

<p>
0758 started seeding canola to F05<br>
0824 finished seeding canola to F05<br>
0825 started seeding canola to F04, courseplay ETA 2h 35min... uh oh, FS19 time sink strikes back, the horror... <b>the horror...</b> ;)<br>
1035 finished seeding canola to F04
</p>

<p>
1037 Decided to call it a night, too tired. Honestly not sure if I continue tomorrow, it was fun kinda now to take a break from elite exploring, but I mostly just watched welker farms videos instead of playing as courseplay did all the playing as usual hehe :)
</p>

<p>
2005 woke up, had a days first meal and now back at PMC Gaming, lets continue farming Midwest Horizons.<br>
2008 Started seeding canola F80, courseplay ETA 29min.<br>
</p>

<p>
But minute or two later PMC Gaming windows went haywire due electrical spike hardware glitch (long story), it did not recognize my mouse and was just weird, had to hard reset the computer.
</p>

<p>
2023 Alright started again, canola to F80, courseplay ETA 29min.
</p>

<p>
Again computer went haywire with mouse moving causing windows beep sounds and strange issues like that, I have never seen windows do that.
</p>

<p>
2110 Continuing seeding canola manually now, reset courseplay secondary action back to right mouse button. No idea if that was the issue.<br>
? Finished seeding canola F80<br>
2120 Started spraying herbicide to F80<br>
2135 Finished spraying herbicide to F80<br>
2137 Started spraying herbicide to F04, courseplay ETA 50min heh<br>
2227 Finished spraying herbicide to F04<br>
2228 Started spraying herbicide to F05<br>
2235 Finished spraying herbicide to F05
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring so now all fields are fertilized, limed, seeded canola and herbicide sprayed. Now we just wait for crops to grow.
</p>

<p>
Exited FS19 to configure keyboard controls a bit due the HOTAS shuffle.
</p>

<p>
2253 Started fertilizing F80<br>
2302 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
2304 Started fertilizing F04, courseplay ETA 23min
</p>

<p>
Noticed that F04 and F05 has weeds in them, umm how did that happen after I herbicide sprayed all the fields?
</p>

<p>
2326 Finished fertilizing F04<br>
2330 Started fertilizing F05<br>
2334 Finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
So NOW all the fields are fully fertilized and growing :)
</p>

<p>
Some time accelerating to get crops to grow, weeds still keep growing which I have to say is some kind of savegame porting bug, so I just have to take the weed hit for now (too lazy to weed them for second time) and this savegame should return to normal after next harvest.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer weeds are growing, F04 is quite peppered with them. Going to wait few more days and then go spray them, I think, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer bored, lets go take care of the weeds (while watching youtube farming videos hehe)
</p>

0703 Sold canola for 45k<br>
0732 Sold canola for 44.9k
</p>

<p>
This F04 is not even that big of a field yet but man has it taken HOURS to harvest it with john deere T560 combine using 7.6m header. So much time spent playing is EXACTLY what I wanted to avoid in the first place, all I wanted was 5-10min quick fun... well this is not quick, I started to harvest this field on 0439hrs and still <b>three hours later</b> I'm going it. Oh wow is this that you call a quick fun?
</p>

<p>
0752 Sold canola for 44.5k<br>
0756 Finished harvesting canola F04<br>

0832 Sold canola for 12.2k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 619.4k quite nice.
</p>

<p>
My quick 5-10min fun has turned into couple of full days of playing (almost), so I've had my fun now, I can already see the horror that time sink game-play style approaching, I cannot get back into wasting my time playing like that, I just cant. So I'm not going to rage quit but will park the vehicles, save game and exit nicely, then backup savegame files. After that I'm done playing FS19 again, I cant waste my time, sorry.
</p>

<p>
0839 Repaired combine and header, budget now 617.5k. Time to call it a loooong night for FS19.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-15T0300</b> Back in FS19, lets continue where we left off.
</p>

<p>
Yes I know that I wrote above that going to take a long break... but FS19 v1.5.1 patch is to be released today and I just could not resist playing hehe, oh well.

<p>
Sold pronto seeder and leased amazon condor 15001 seeder, I need to get seed to the ground quicker.
</p>

<p>
0434 Started seeding soybeans F80, courseplay ETA 17min, pretty nice.<br>
0438 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0441 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0444 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0447 Sold canola for 10k<br>
0450 Sold joskin trailer and 100k liter grain bin silo, will have to get a larger ones. Budget now 923.1k
</p>

<p>
Biggest limitation in my farm right now was the grain bin silo, it was the giants default placeable of 100k liters which was already full of canola. I wanted to upgrade into PMC large farm bin silo which holds 10 million liters, so sold the canola and the small bin silo.
</p>

<p>
0504 Finished seeding soybeans F80<br>
0506 Started seeding soybeans F04, courseplay ETA 1h 50min uuh ;)<br>
0536 Purchased small land lot between F77 through F79 for 69.2k<br>
0538 Purchased PMC large grain bin silo (capacity 10 million liters) for 180k
</p>

<p>
This small land lot is just north from my fields, its a nice place to stamp down that large farm bin silo and I can even add few extra storage bins for it. Now I don't have to worry about silo capacity but just keep farming and storing the valuable crops for the time when market prices are the highest. With this fleet of equipment I have now, 10 million liter silo capacity lasts forever heh.
</p>

<p>
0543 Purchased strautmann aperion 3401 trailer for 65k<br>

0709 Finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
Now all fields were seeded soybeans and fertilized to 66% stage, next is to wait until fields get germinated and grow first stage so get to fertilize one last time.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-summer in-game 0641hrs fields got germinated and are now growing. Also noticed one tiny spec of weeds in F04.
</p>

<p>
0724 Field growth stage changed, green small plants appeared. Okay lets fertilize some more.<br>

<p>
Now all fields are fully fertilized and growing. Time accelleration commences until possible herbicide spraying.
</p>

<p>
05/mid-autumn in-game 0834hrs (real life 0828hrs hehe) soybeans are ready to harvest with minimum of weeds, very nice!
</p>

<p>
Now I just need to decide what kind of solution I take for combine, I really do not want spend endless hours harvesting with that one john deere T560. Decided to sell the T560 and buy S790.
</p>

<p>
0832 Sold john deere T560 and header<br>
0833 Purchased john deere S790 for 390k and macdon fd75 header for 82.7k
</p>

<p>
Now I got some harvesting power heh.
</p>

<p>
0837 Started harvesting soybeans F80, courseplay ETA 32min<br>
0915 Finished harvesting soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
Got 54,001 liters of soybeans out of F80.
</p>

<p>
0917 Started harvesting soybeans F04<br>
1059 Finished harvesting soybeans F04
</p>

<p>
Uh oh that took a while, close to two hours... that is not quick fun. But I guess this is just continuing the Start From Zero now instead of 5-10min quick fun heh.
</p>

<p>
1103 Started harvesting soybeans F05<br>
1115 Finished harvesting soybeans F05
</p>

<p>
That's it, all done, all soybean crops harvested.
</p>

<p>
Soybean harvest for F04 185,695 liters and F05 26,788 liters.
</p>

<p>
1123 Saved game and exited, enough farming for tonight.
</p>

<p>
2218 Upgraded FS19 to v1.5.1 where the changelog didn't have much of interesting stuff, except the AI memory leak. No idea what that means in practice though, someone in giants forums speculated that could that fix the performance loss when AI hired workers (courseplay) is running (edit: it most certainly did not).
</p>

<p>
2259 Started FS19 v1.5.1 for the first time. Lets continue growing our farm, will be interesting to see today how we proceed.
</p>

<p>
Here is the recap; I own now F04, F05 and F80, plus the land lot where the farm bin silo is placed, got 266.4k liters of soybeans, current budget 337.3k hmm, I'm thinking should I do one more harvest with this setup or try to buy more land or upgrade equipment.
</p>

<p>
I really don't like the two hour courseplay ETA's no matter how much youtube farming videos I have to watch to catch up, its just such a waste of time to fiddle your thumbs while game-play takes hours. In two hours I could get so much elite exploring or arma3 editing or playing done that its just shameful waste of time to spend so long doing FS19 field work. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Decided to buy a seeder as previously I just leased it. Then it was time to do the remaining fieldwork for the winter so we are as ready as possible next spring for the next seeding. Or maybe I'll do fallow year dunno.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Then it was time accelerating through one year :)
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer soybean prices were sky high and they wont go higher than that according to the seasons market price history, its time to sell. Currently horizion coop pays 3779 per thousand liters, lets start hauling. Budget before starting to sell 129.6k
</p>

</p>

<p>
After selling budget 1.136 million! :)
</p>

<p>
07/late-summer soybean planting season was over and I was looking at some AI owned soybean fields to buy, F03, F06 and F78 are interesting. My combine harvester is the weak link now, perhaps even sprayer too, so getting more fields does really not help in my productivity as existing fields already take hours to combine but I bet the money I get from the new field soybeans would easily pay extra combine harvester which would be really helpful.
</p>

<p>
0226 Purchased land lot with F78 in it for 431.7k, F06 for 347.4k and F03 for 291k. Budget now 66.4k heh<br>

0846 Time to call it a night, was a really late start today so got energy only for such quick fieldwork.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-19T1530</b> Yikes back at FS19, forgot to write starting time down but I haven't done anything else than time accelerating 6000 speed so not much story to tell. Looking forward for the spring season and starting to seed new crops.<br>
1538 Season switched to 01/early-spring.<br>
1548 Started seeding canola F78, courseplay ETA 53min
</p>

<p>
Looks like courseplay v6.01.611 cant handle backing up that amazone condor 15001 seeder, it always messes it up, I noticed this already version or two ago and have a "last good version" batch file I can use. Will have to revert to that last good version again on the next game restart.
</p>

<p>
Because courseplay is such a nuisance (it actually does more harm than good) decided to switch to GPS at least it stops at the end of a row, then I can quickly turn the tractor around where courseplay would take forever and in this particular case it didn't even work with the backing up.
</p>

<p>
1637 Too tired have to call it a night, this was a really short farming set now, more tomorrow.
</p>

<p>

F01 had withered sugar beets so I just went lazily and seeded canola on top of it as condor 15001 cultivates as well. I wanted to get a plow and real cultivator to properly plow this field under with fertilization etc but don't have the money, oh well lets do it this way for now.

<p>
And that wrapped up the planting season for this spring. Not sure what I put down as double crop, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Next we are going to fertilize the fields and then comes time acceleration. At that point we start to see weeds growing so we have to decide if we go spray them. Once enough days go by then we get into soybeans selling day, it should be roughly first day of mid-summer. Then we get a lot of money from the 337k liters of soybeans, depending on the sell price. Money which is then used to purchase at least powerful tractor to pull cultivator, I'd also like to buy a second combine but we'll have to see how much money we'll make from the sales.
</p>

<p>
0504 Started fertilizing F80, courseplay ETA 8min<br>

Speaking of weeds, first medium size patch already appeared on F80 when I was fertilizing it. I have been quite lucky with weeds as so little of them have appeared, although I did blanked spray the whole fields previously if I recall correctly.

Okay all work done (well besides possible herbicide spraying), now its time to skip ahead to the soybean selling time with those good market prices :)
</p>

<p>
08/late-spring looks like F78 and F80 are getting fair amount of weeds. I'll keep monitoring them.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer is here and the best day/time to sell soybeans. Currently in-game 0611hrs soybean market price is 3725 in horizion coop. Time to start haulin' :)
</p>

<p>
Just as I started hauling soybeans for sell the current canola crops switched to harvest ready, uh oh I completely missed that in my soybean sell excitement, now my fields are somewhat weeded. Weeds are not too bad but yeah F78 northern part and F80 looked sort of nasty, oh well next time I'll keep a better handle on things, this kind of slipped away from me now heh. Anyways lets get to hauling grain...
</p>

<p>
So to recap we got 337,245 liters of soybeans and currently the market price is 3725 per thousand liters. Thats pretty nice set to sell.
</p>

<p>
0832 Sold soybeans for 193.7k<br>

0902 Ran out of soybeans in the farm bin silo, only got 25.2k liters, last haul<br>
0905 Sold soybeans for 94k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.266 million, yeah! :)
</p>

<p>
Soybeans market price did not drop at all during selling, it remained solid 3725. Next is some vehicle purchases, I definitely need cultivator and tractor to pull it, I'm going to get my workhorse big bud 450 and john deere 2410 5 section cultivator (flexicoil would be nice but its more expensive). Also I need another combine so that these harvests get done quicker.
</p>

<p>
0126 Was too tired had to go back to sleep, just one of those days... more farming after few more hours of sleep.
</p>

<p>
0523 Nap done and had a nice meal, time to get back to farming. Lets continue lime spreading...
</p>

0607 Finished lime spreading F05<br>
0608 Started lime spreading F06, courseplay ETA 29min
</p>

<p>
Was not planning on spreading lime to F06 as it didn't really require it, but it had so many patches of lime required due seasons crops failing patches that it kept annoying me, so here we go lets blanket it with lime, be done with it.
</p>

<p>
The crops failed patches created by seasons is great... but they basically cause you to cultivate after each harvest so you can clean them off. For example on withered crops lime will not stick, only fertilizer sticks through all the patches created by seasons. Its really annoying to have these patches in the field after harvest while working on the next one.
</p>

<p>
While lime spreading was running it was time to buy some vehicles.
</p>

<pre>
- auger wagon 300hp brent 1596 53k liter 118k
- trailer krampe sb II 30/1070 78k
- truck lizard hulk with paint 146k
</pre>
<p>
0630 Purchased above list for 342k
</p>

<p>
I was really struggling with the almost beginner level grain trailer, on the last harvest it was really painful to use. Now with the truck and proper auger wagon I can harvest normally, unloading the combines with auger wagon while truck is hauling a load to the farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
When time comes to sell my crops, the truck and trailer does proper job on it unlike tractor (with twin wheels that it wont fit horizion coop hehe). I wanted to buy wilson trailer but because using courseplay I cant as it would only fill one hopper, thats why I use krampe.
</p>

<p>
All done now in preparation for seeding. Two days left in soybeans planting season but was thinking of not to push it and just time accelerate to canola selling day, do some selling and then time accelerate rest of the year until spring.
</p>

<p>
But eventually decided to go for it and seed soybeans, never done that so late in the seeding season (05/mid-summer 0800hrs) so will be interesting to see if they get harvest ready before winter kills them off. They should grow ok.

Soybeans have been seeded, aayeah! I hope after the next grain sell I have enough money to buy better seeding equipment and perhaps even corn planter so that future seeding seasons go by quickly, this amazone condor 15001 is quite nice medium size seeder but once you start to stack up those hectares on big fields... yeah its not so nice anymore.

Soybean seeding is complete with full fertilization. Now its just time accelerating keeping an eye on weed growth, then when canola selling day comes we make some money.
</p>

<p>
Not sure when our soybeans will be ready, they were seeded really late so hopefully they are harvest ready before winter kills them off, it possibly could be around the time canola selling day comes. Will be interesting to see.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-summer in-game 1520hrs fields got germinated succesfully, thats odd as I recall germination happens midnight, hmm maybe the growth stage change still is only applied according to seeding time or something, dunno.
</p>

<p>
03/early-autumn in-game 0713hrs very few weeds have grown so far, five small patches in F06 rest are clean. We are now already well into soybeans harvest season but obviously ours is still very much growing, they arent even flowering yet.
</p>

<p>
Decided to go herbicide spray F06 by cherry picking only the weed patches. That was done quick, took couple of minutes.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-autumn in-game 0810hrs fields are ready to harvest! wow that happened much sooner than I expected, nice. Okay, lets start harvesting then :)

Using massey ferguson 7726 with 270hp to pull brent 1596 auger wagon which requires 400hp, you can <i>really</i> feel how underpowered the tractor is. It pulls it, sure... but you really appreciate something with proper horsepower like fendt 1050.

Now I have 901.8k liters of canola and 683.9k liters of soybeans. That is going to make me some serious amount of money to develop my farm heh. Next its just time accelerating until we are in the canola selling day.
</p>

<p>
Missed the highest selling day because I was waiting for the price to increase some more, looks like the specific day is when you get the highest price you just have to take what price you get, or wait for the next year for better luck. Price was indeed 2200 but dropped when I time accelerated some more. Oh well now have to sell for 2058 per thousand liters.

Right now I'm going to take a break from Midwest Horizon Start From Zero career and play one of the <a href="pmc-terrains.php">PMC terrains</a> instead.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-03-25T1407</b> Back at Start From Zero Midwest Horizon :)
</p>

<p>
Here we are back in Midwest Horizon, I got quite bored if not burnt out for <a href="stories-from-zero-grande-gardens.php">PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero</a> savegame so change of terrain would do me good. I kind of miss the smaller scale farming again. I read through this page up until I took the above break, so after finishing reading I was absolutely going to play this savegame some, I just simply need some small scale farming also in some bizarre way its nice to play on someone elses terrain :)
</p>

<p>
First needed to add macdon FD75 combine header mod back in to get savegame loaded, then purged out few obsolete mods from the savegame too. I'm unsure about switching macdon FD75 to midwest durus 18m because it might be too wide of an header for S790 auger pipe lenght. It annoys me as I want to get rid of this macdon mod but now its unecessarily (well, kinda) holding up this savegame until I upgrade to claas lexion 8900s combine. Oh well I guess I have to live with this for now.
</p>

<p>
02/early-winter and we have 683.9k liters of soybeans in the farm bin silo, highest selling day is still far away next year. Cash is 1.907m which is nice but not anything grande heh.

Went through my vehicles, nice medium size kit I have going on here. I have serious problem when growing my farm by purchasing new vehicles and land, I have impossible difficulties choosing what <a href="equipment-vehicle-prices.php">equipment and vehicles</a> to buy to maximize my growth. Now I have close to two million in cash plus plenty of more in my soybeans stock, so first off I'd like to sell the soybeans before committing into new purchases so I can know what kind of budget I'm getting. Sure I could estimate it with average soybeans sell price, but that is risky.
</p>

<p>
Did a field state check to make a list of fertilizing etc field work asks that need to be done, its then easy to just work through the list and enjoy farming :)
</p>

<p>
1439 Finished creating list of field work
</p>

<p>
Heh half an hour since start and now I have familiarized myself with my vehicles and fields, did that list of what field work I need to do and what crops to seed next to follow seasons crop rotation. We are going to plant corn, so that means I need to buy at least the corn planter.
</p>

<pre>
- planter 280hp 18.2m 5800 liter great plains yp-2425a 142k
</pre>
<p>
1443 Purchased the above, budget now 1.765m
</p>

<p>
Purchased seed refill placeable for 7.5k, solid fertilizer, liquid fertilizer and herbicide tanks as well, 7.5k or 8.5k something and finally lime station for whopping 30k. I'm done playing with single pallets.
</p>

<p>
1453 Started fertilizing F80, courseplay ETA 7min<br>
1500 Finished fertilizing F80
</p>

<p>
Seven minutes for field work, oh my, in PMC Grande Gardens 16km its more like seven HOURS haha. So awesome to do such quick tasks, this is really enjoyable farming time wise.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking about purchasing another bredal spreader to be used as dedicated lime machine but decided against it, now we only have two fields that require lime and I can easily do one fertilizer to lime and back again flip flop with my existing bredal. Maybe after the soybeans have been sold I can purchase my first fertilizer sprayer (rubicon 9000 of course) and then this bredal is left into lime spreading task.
</p>

02/early-winter in-game 1808hrs night has fallen, its time to skip the night. 03/early-winter in-game 0822hrs, weather -4/0C, chilly. I wonder when we are not able to cultivate and fertilize anymore hmm I guess when the soil freezes? It was so long time ago when I experienced that, actually I recall you can cultivate even when there are snow on the ground (although snow on the ground doesn't necessarily mean frozen soil, does it?). Aanyways.

All field work for corn planting preparations is done now. Next is nothing but time accelerating waiting for next year and corn planting weather temperatures to arrive. Soybeans best market price selling day is just about the end of corn planting season too.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-winter in-game 0831hrs weather -5/-1C, chilly chilly chilly...
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0716hrs new year has started. Weather +4/+2C, looking good.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-spring in-game 0726hrs soybeans and corn planting season has begun, weather 9/5C, we continue waiting for weather to warm up the soil. In-game 1727hrs soybeans went high demand on cooper farms grain for 3667, but I think even the normal best selling day should give better price so I'll wait for it.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-spring in-game 0656hrs weather 9/10C and forecast predicts from noon today the lowest temperature will not drop below +11C, so we are good to go planting corn, I'll just wait until tomorrow to be sure about the weather forecast.
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 0647hrs weather 12/12C and forecast predicts pretty much the same as yesterday, okay lets begin corn planting.

Hardi navigator sprayer had only 1051 liters of herbicide left so while waiting for corn planting on F06 to finish I went to refilled the sprayer.
</p>

<p>
1108 Corn planter needs a refill
<p>

<p>
Distances in 4km terrains are laughable so its no big deal to drive corn planter to north of F78 where my farm bin silo and fert/seed/etc refill station placeables are located, but yeah for the next years planting seasons I am going to use auger wagon to haul seeds behind a seeder/planter so these kinds of back and forth drives aren't necessary.
</p>

<p>
Actually I'm quite happy how quickly the corn planting is going, maybe its because I'm used to roll down the field with four big bud 747s pulling seed hawks and those tasks generally last like two hours or more hehe. Maybe I could purchase another tractor and great plains YP-2425A planter if I have enough money, but at the moment such half an hour seeding times are like nothing, even the F78 is 49min which is ... man if its minutes instead of hours, don't complain! hehe

<p>
Started up john deere S790s, unhooked the macdon FD75 headers and then drove them to the shop.
</p>

<p>
1147 Purchased two john deere 618c headers for 57k each. Budget now 1.488m
</p>

<p>
Next we time accelerate until soybeans selling day or our corn crops are ready to harvest.
</p>

<p>
08/late-spring in-game 0653hrs minute or two after time accelerating our corn fields switched to germinated state.
</p>

<p>
For some reason I wasnt that big of a hurry, yesterday I already started to watch my old FS17 (yes seventeen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKt0kt4BAeflHaQj4eML9cu0G4wo9Hz1j" target="_blank">youtube PMC FS17 Playlist</a>) videos. Was quite amazed how good quality 4k 60FPS footage they are after the youtube upload. I should really start to do more videos again, but I rather make videos of PMC terrains instead of something that anyone can do at any time (Midwest Horizon). Anyways, it was very relaxing to watch those old videos kind of like nostalgia stuff heh.
</p>

<p>
F78 had semi big weed patch, WHAT THE? Excuse me but I pre-emptive blanked herbicide sprayed all my fields and now one of then is growing a weed patch, how come? Seasons v1.2 buggy or something wrong with my savegame? What is going on here?
</p>

<p>
This is really, hmm how should I describe it, not like depressing that come on its a one weed patch get over it, but still all this work I've put to care my fields and its for nothing as weeds still creep into them, I just don't get it. This sucks.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 0637hrs on F80 corn is on growing stage, green plants popped up, nice. No more weeds yet, just that one patch in F78. I googled "seasons weeds spraying" but could not find anything useful except one guy reported the same as me, I spray and weeds still grow.
</p>

<p>
02/early-summer in-game 1535hrs soybeans market price 3620. Still no more weed patches, I think that one single patch is some weird fluke, someone might say you missed a spot but no I didn't as courseplay systematically blanketed the whole field.
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer in-game 0615hrs soybeans market price 3654 and increasing. If my notes are correct tomorrow after midnight is the time for highest market price. At 1231hrs its 3756 stable. No more weed patches, good. At 1504hrs its 3773 stable. At 1807hrs its 3789 stable. At 2107hrs its 3806 stable. At 2207hrs its 3811 stable. At 2310hrs its 3817 stable.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer in-game 0012hrs soybeans market price 3822 stable. Now I'm going to increment one hour intervals to see if it still goes up and if it starts to come down then I'm going to start selling. At 0106hrs its 3808 and decreasing, wow well that took a long time hehe.
</p>

<p>
It is my experience on various savegames with seasons market prices that the highest price happens like soybeans 04/mid-summer in-game right after midnight like seen here, even one hour later the market is already falling.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Alright that is it, all my 683k liters of soybeans have been sold, roughly in the high 3700s price. Budget now 4.077m whoah very very nice! :)
</p>

<p>
And now I'm in the everlasting dilemma; I have a lot of money but undecided what to buy in order to grow my farm the quickest way possible heh. Always the same issue, dude gets loads of cash and freezes over "OHMIGOD WHAT DO I DO NOW HALP HALP!" hehe.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer in-game 0626hrs time accelerated until morning daylight, there was a brief rain during the night hours too. Corn is growing and looking good. I believe the corn is now on the mapview second green colored growth stage, 3D small green plants.
</p>

<p>
Still no other weeds have grown, only that one single alone spec on about middle of F78. Must be some demon beastly weed from depths of HELL ;)
</p>

<p>
Soybeans market price had dropped down to 3705 now, not terribly bad but definitely you need to be alert at midnight when the best selling day starts, to maximize your profits.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking of what do I do with all the money but realized that corn harvest is waiting for me and then there is nothing to do as fields will be fallow next year. I'm going to do the corn harvest and while it gets boring driving grain cart around it gives me plenty of time to plan about purchases to grow my farm. For example I'm pretty sure it will be land AND vehicle purchases. I want to grow the farm evenly out not picking and choosing land lots to buy, this way there is less driving back and forth.
</p>

<p>
Four million is quite a lot of money, I could buy ONE set of top of the line vehicles with that money easily like no need to pick and choose but just get the best of everything. That would leave me probably money to buy a land lot too hmm.
</p>

<p>
08/late-summer in-game 0720hrs corn switched to last growth stage, full man sized green corn plants.
</p>

<p>
F77 is growing soybeans, its pretty big field and would definitely make a lot of money if I'd buy and harvest that, I think it would pretty much pay the land lot back right away, hmm. Also its right next to F78 and the area where my farm bin silo and refill station are. Hmm hmm, I don't think I need to even consider this any longer, I need to buy this field and get the money from the crop :)
</p>

<p>
Decision was made to buy that land lot, however I'm going to wait until the soybeans grow because there is a chance AI owner will fertilize/weed the field as right now there is no fertilization at all. Also, the crop is growing there is no hurry to buy it yet, where would the crop go heh, they will be here for me to buy later when they are ready to harvest. Just have to keep a close eye on it that AI wont manage to harvest them when I'm not looking.
</p>

<p>
So plan is set and now its more time acceleration waiting for crops to grow. 01/early-autumn in-game 0737hrs F77 soybeans are ready to harvest, nothing was done for the fertilization and weeds. My corn fields switched to golden brown color but still are dark green in mapview.
</p>

<p>
1534 Purchased land lot with F77 for 684.3k, budget now 3.392m<br>
</p>

<p>
Drove john deere S790s to farm bin silo area, swapped corn headers to normal ones, then I was ready to commence my new soybean field harvest.
</p>

<p>
1548 Started harvesting soybeans F77, courseplay ETA 1h 36min, 2x tools<br>
1606 In-game 0809hrs it started to rain, forecast is rain basically the whole day until midnight...
</p>

<p>
In-game 1200hrs rain ended, however weather forecast predicts more rain from 1800hrs to midnight, so I doubt we get much soybeans harvesting done today as soil/crop has to dry up first. But by luck in-game 1538hrs crops are dry enough to harvest, alright lets continue! :)
</p>

<p>
1642 Short break...<br>
1658 Break is over, back to farming<br>
1753 Finished harvesting soybeans F77
</p>

<p>
New field purchase F77 soybeans harvest was total of 219,054 liters. If we calculate with somewhat good market price of 3750 we get 821,250 and if we subtract the price I paid from this land lot with F77 on it, we get 136,950 profit AND the land lot in the first place! haha oh man why would I ever buy any land without soybeans crop growing on it I cannot imagine reason why hehe ;)
</p>

<p>
04/mid-autumn in-game 0803hrs my corn fields are ready to harvest, alright lets get to work. I doubt this harvest will be done today before I snooze off to sleep, but I'll try to push on as long as possible. Crop is still too high moisture but a bit time acceleration will fix that.
</p>

<p>
1839 Started harvesting corn F78, courseplay ETA 1h 13min, 2x tools<br>
</p>

<p>
Corn harvest was a nice change as I have been doing what feels like weeks of constant never ending soybeans harvest with the best vehicles on 200ha and larger fields. But I must say that massey ferguson 7726 pulling brent avalanche 1596 auger wagon felt really clunky, turning left was extremely difficult, almost like the tractor needed front weight but I did not see any slippage on the wheels which was odd, also why the issue only turning left, weird.
</p>

<p>
John Deere S790 combines with 618C corn headers was nice change sure, but oh man 9m header width? My last weeks experience was with 18m haha, ok well sure the capello quasar hs16 is only 12m corn/sunflower header but still. Dunno why giants S790 will not link with capello header, at least the store compatible selection does not list it, I know from real life minnesota millennial farmer did have capello on his john deere combine as test. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
After this years harvest I'm SO going to sell these S790s and buy the largest combine :)
</p>

<p>
Corn seems to yield good, man the amounts of 53k liter auger wagons I'm cutting from this F78 heh, very nice.

<p>
This years harvest season is over! Aayeah always so nice to finish up yearly work and by yearly I mean harvest marks the end of the year even though often times you already begin field preparation for the next year by fertilizing etc.
</p>

<p>
Corn harvest from F01, F03, F04, F05, F06, F78 and F80 yielded 1.399m liters. My land purchase F77 soybeans harvest was 219k liters.
</p>

<p>
Decided to shut down FS19 and backup my savegames, I was kind of considering upgrading to Midwest Horizon v1.3.1 but because its such performange hog I was not sure yet.
</p>

<p>
After taking another look at Midwest Horizon v1.3.1 it felt like messy to stay on v1.1 as newer version is out even though the new one gives 30FPS performance on the dumb corn building and few other location around the terrain (then other/rest areas give normal 60FPS performance). So I went to prepared my v1.1 savegame by shuffling some equipment around the dealership backyard so they wont get stuck into trees, saved game and exited.
</p>

<p>
1253 Had all the terrain and savegame porting pretty much done
</p>

<p>
It is so difficult to port terrain and savegame when using seasons because of all the crop rotation and such yearly things. It would be best never to upgrade, but obviously in a computer world where we get updates we must upgrade or be left behind, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Decided to keep all my owned fields now fallow even though I could have planted corn into the new F77 as it was soybeans before (and I think fallow before that), but at the moment I don't know how to debug console input or XML edit such fallow settings for seasons. Its not a big deal though, not like some cheating would be going on because of it etc, I just prefer to let these fields in this savegame now be fallow the year which just started. We skipped from 04/mid-autumn into 01/early-spring now with this savegame porting.
</p>

<p>
Plan is now to first sell off all the vehicles I'm going to upgrade for example seeder, cultivator and combines. Then buy new equipment and as much land as we have money for. Land I will buy evenly out from the SE corner, I don't want to skip areas because of long distance traveling sucks.

</p>

<p>
The whole fleet cost 3.459m, budget now 1.252m.
</p>

<p>
I took a look at seasons savegame files and crop rotation seems to be saved into a GRLE file, so I'm assuming there is no way to developer console configure the field states, maybe I'm wrong dunno. Anyways I'll go with my owned fields as fallow this year and new land I buy will be worked according to crop rotation.

<p>
Budget now 67.8k heh money is running low, but oh well I have bunch of crops in the farm bin silo waiting for the selling day :)
</p>

<p>
1401 Started fertilizing F08, GPS
</p>

<p>
When starting rubicon 9000 fertilizing on top of corn field I realized that GPS lines or the dark fertilized field texture are not visible... also Midwest Horizon v1.3.1 trees flicker like crazy and in this SE area I get constant 30FPS performance. I cant play like this.
</p>

<p>
1421 Finished fertilizing F08
</p>

<p>
Went from excitement of installing new terrain version, purchasing new vehicle fleet and more land... to a complete disapointment. I just didn't want to play midwest horizon right now, it just felt so uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
1423 Shut down FS19...
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-03-30T1805</b> Well "I cant play like this" was my comment few days ago, but here I am with nothing else to do or other savegames feeling interesting so decided to give 30FPS midwest horizon another try.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I could play a bit more but at least I have something to do.
</p>

<p>
1816 Started lime spreading F08, courseplay ETA 1h 1min<br>
1818 Started fertilizing F83, courseplay ETA 8min<br>
1826 Finished fertilizing F83<br>
</p>

<p>
Courseplay failed to generate two headland course for F08, it just reverted to one headland, so tractor kept hitting field edge fences and trees all the time, I decided to delete the course and just drive res with GPS. Sucks.
</p>

<p>
1935 Finished lime spreading F08<br>

1954 Again courseplay did lousy job (well ok field shape and size was really bad), finished it off with manual GPS driving<br>
2000 Finished lime spreading F82<br>
2002 Started fertilizing F82, GPS (field too small for rubicon 9000)<br>
2005 Finished fertilizing F82
</p>

<p>
F82 was the only one of my fields which allowed planting in order to maintain crop rotation. I think. So I decided to just time accelerate this year letting all my fields be fallow and in next season we start all over again with soybeans.
</p>

<p>
This year is for grain sales only, have 219k liters of soybeans and 1.399m liters of corn, ugh that corn will be horror to haul into selling point hehe. I probably going to lease another truck to get it done more quickly, I mean with quick calculation that is 20 truck loads, hmm dunno perhaps if the best selling price is on horizion coop then maybe I wont lease the truck, just watch videos while my own truck does some hauling.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer in-game 0107hrs soybeans market price in horizion coop is 3747 which is pretty OK, cooper farms grain is 3775 and decreasing. I'm going to sell into horizion coop, yes I'm lazy heh.

</p>

<p>

<p>
Budget now 3.086m alright quite nice chunk of cash from last years harvest.
</p>

<p>
While spending this fallow year I'm already planning on purchasing some lucrative land lot with field growing soybeans. F81 which is on my farm area, middle of it actually is growing canola so I guess there is no doubt that I'll buy that. F65 grows soybeans but its on NE corner, not really far away but still lot of empty ground between it and my farm. F88 is soybeans and F89 is canola, small fields and well south central area.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated few hours and corn went high demand on horizion coop for 1911 hehe, oh wow man if I had waited just a bit before selling I would have made so much more money :)
</p>

<p>
2246 Purchased land lot with F81 for 577.1k
</p>

<p>
2251 Started harvesting canola F81, courseplay ETA 1h 42min
</p>

<p>
Canola field had really bad yield, perhaps I had false impression after the "perfect corn" harvest, but man did the combine cut in the field for what felt like endless time before it got even half full heh. This was lime needing and only 33% fertilized canola, so guess the lack of liming and fertilizing really takes its toll on the crops. Perfect canola should give grain cart driver run for his money thats for sure, even though its not as high yielding as corn. Overall I got bored to death sitting and waiting for the combine to get full.
</p>

<p>
Did a quick calculation about profit from this canola harvest against the land price I paid, its about 250k liters of canola required in order to pay off this land lot. Now obviously its never a requirement that you get land for free (crop pays off the land price) but it is awesome bonus. Just now it looks like I wont get nowhere near those amounts of canola liters I'd need to offset the land price. So guess canola land lot purchase is not such an good idea, it has to be soybeans and more or less good preparation like fertilized and not needing plowing or lime.
</p>

<p>
Before buying the land lot I did not calculate anything, I just assumed canola is good yielding and decent paying crop that sure it would pay good chunk of the land price... but guess I was wrong. Not that this was anyway a bad purchase, in fact I would have probably bought this land lot even if it was harvested because its right in the middle of my farm area and very nice good shaped large 28ha field.
</p>

<p>
<b>2020-03-31T0033</b> Finished harvesting canola F81
</p>

<p>
Got 87.9k liters of canola from this field, if we calculate it with the highest market price it would be around 204k, not even half of the land price. But like said its all good, 204k is better than paying the full land price. Next time we only buy soybeans field lands :)
</p>

<p>
Alright so that was our new land purchase and quickie (well 1h 42min courseplay ETA) harvest for this year, now we just keep time accelerating because there will be no soybeans fields for sale anymore. Maybe just maybe if I get bored I might check if lucrative fertilizer contracts are available and go scoop those in with rubicon, dunno probably not.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0659hrs, alright new year has started. I wish seasons would list the played years, now they don't seem to mean anything. After all that time accelerating decided to restart FS19, just in case.
</p>

<p>
Wanted to try play in real time to see how long can I last before I must time accelerate, meaning working through the pitch black nights. I really don't like the darkness but just thought I'd try how it would play out in the long run. Obviously when all the field work is done that you have to wait for crops to grow or end of the year to spring come again... you obviously are not going to wait in real time for days heh, just playing real time while you have field work going on.
</p>

<p>
0131 Purchased land lot with F02 and F84 for 233.1k and land lot with F07, F85 and F86 for 536k and land lot with F11 for 554.7k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.184m alright now we start a whole new year field work and seed soybeans, new crop rotation begins, aayeah! :)

I was thinking of buying my first tanker trailer so I could haul fertilizer to the fields, but I don't think my farm operation is that big yet, I can manage to drive my rubicon to farm and the edge of my farm area now.

My field work was just coming to an end, I had some money left so decided to buy few close by fields, they were in fallow so they could join my other fields in crop rotation, also they increase my farm size evenly very nicely.
</p>

<p>
1945 Purchased land lot with F09 on it for 133.5k, land lot with F10 on it for 235.9k, land lot with F12 on it for 175.4k, land lot with F13 on it for 192.4k

01/early-spring in-game 1840hrs it is getting dark, well basically its dark already I cant see the ground anymore. Now we get to see if I manage to work through the night like play in 24hrs day without time acceleration, I know it will be so cool to get into the morning daylight break but man that long dark night ahead of me heh, lets see if I can get through it :)
</p>

<p>
In-game 1847hrs it gets darker and darker now I cant see the field surface at all anymore, I just turned on 9 minimap and drive according to its guidance and my vehicles limited lights. This will cause issues through the night but hopefully I can manage.

<p>
All the field preparation work has been done, all fields ready for seeding. Now we just need to wait until soybeans planting season starts and weather improves so soil is above +10C degrees.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 2026hrs so here we are the plan was to work through the nights, but heh I didn't actually plan that I would finish all the field preparation work so quickly in one gaming session. Now its dark and well I mean I have nothing to do even if it was daylight. Sure there are three fertilizing contracts but that is just nonsense that I would start to do something to pass the time haha.
</p>

<p>
Yeah how about if we forget this work through the night nonsense heh, when it gets dark you time accelerate until the morning daylight as usual :)
</p>

<p>
It was a nice idea and possibly required to do if you had animals which needed feeding or something, but no not in this kind of normal grain crop operations nope. So I'll start to time accelerate until we reach soybeans planting temperatures.
</p>

<p>
Bourgault air cart 71300 had no seeds so I topped it up, usually this is done with elmer haulmaster as it has nice auger pipe and 70k liter capacity but for a while I have been on a lookout for something better as the tractor only pulls it 63km/h. Now I tried just for fun that could I overload from bsm truck trailer into the air cart auger spoon thingy and I could, wow never knew that. So now I'm going to swap all my seed hauling from elmers haulmaster to the trucks which are faster and I think more powerful than the tractor. Great, another efficiency improvement for my farm operations across all savegames :)
</p>

<p>
BTW 70k liters of seeds from the giants refill station costs 69.2k heh, not cheap, but I guess the seeds pay themselves back big time when you seed that many soybeans :)
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 0708hrs weather is 10/11C and forecast predicts temperature wont drop below +10C anymore, so we are good to go for soybeans planting season.
</p>

Uuuh I'm dead tired, alarm for been awake 17hrs rang a long time ago... wow this is one of the longest FS19 sessions I've had in a while, heh. Okay gotta shut it down and get ready to bed.

<p>
1803 New farming day has started. Plan was to edit today but for various reasons decided to post pone it for tomorrow april the second.
</p>

<p>
Today we continue the last remaining three herbicide spraying field works, then all we have to do is wait for our soybeans crops to grow, that takes a lot of time accelerating again. At some point the small amount of canola is ready to sell, it might be after soybeans harvest though dunno, hopefully get to do that in todays gaming-session as well.

That is it all the field work for soybeans planting season has been DONE! :)
</p>

<p>
Couple of fields had one single weed patch which I could not herbicide spray away. This pretty much always happens with Seasons v1.2 now, no idea why.
</p>

<p>
2031 Created North Dakota real world data terrain source files for SinisterSockz ;)
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 1626hrs, soybeans have been seeded and herbicide sprayed. Now we just wait for germination. 08/late-spring in-game 0728hrs all fields succesfully germinated. 02/early-summer in-game 0713hrs soybeans switched to growing stage.
</p>

<p>
01/early-autumn in-game 0732hrs soybeans are ready to harvest! Corn on F81 is still growing, thats fine, got plenty of doing with the soybeans first. Of course at this time of the morning crops were still wet.
</p>

<p>
In-game 1136hrs it started to rain, well so much for dry crops hehe. Forecast predicts rain until 1800hrs. At 1617hrs rain had ended, drying potential begins tomorrow at 0300hrs, so no harvesting today then.
</p>

<p>
02/early-autumn in-game 0728hrs, crops are dry, harvest begins now.

Two hour harvester field work oh wow, things are getting large scale in midwest horizon which is only 4km terrain. Once this soybeans harvest is done and grain sold I am buying another claas lexion 8900 combine with midwest durus 18m header, I need more harvesting capability.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Forgot to save courseplay course so now would have to regenerate it, decided that I'm going to lease another lexion 8900 with midwest durus 18m header because doing this harvest with only one is taking way too long, I'm bored to death sitting in the grain cart tractor waiting the combine to get full.
</p>

<p>
Leased claas lexion 8900 initial cost 24.9k, per operating hour 10.2k and per day 4.8k. Hmm that per hour is quite steep price, but lets hope these harvests go by real quickly with two of these bests that the leasing costs wont bleed me dry. And leased midwest durus 18m header initial cost 8.5k, per operating hour 3.5k and per day 1.6k.

I had dream to finish this harvest in todays gaming session but I guess it was started too late in the day that only got so many hours in, as the harvest was perhaps half way through when I already got the alarm of been awake 16hrs (or was it even 17hrs hmm). Yeah time to call it a night, no farming tomorrow as I'm going to try to only edit FS19.
</p>

<p>
0707hrs Shut down FS19, no farming tomorrow...

Looking at seasons calendar I'm thinking about double cropping canola, but not sure if it will make it for this harvest season before winter comes and kills it off. I think canola dies winter time heh not sure.
</p>

<p>
Wanted to try seeding without any field work and see if I can manage to fertilize spray the fields while they are growing. Usually I do three stage fertilization before even seeding.
</p>

<p>
Why wait until the harvest is over, we have courseplay and big bud 747 with bourgault 3420-100 paralink hoe drill behaves very nicely on good shape fields, so I let them go.
</p>

<p>
I'm doing proper crop rotation (soybeans, canola, corn, fallow) but still seasons dit not give me one fertilization stage bonus. Unless I'm mistaken there should be one, but oh well need to do now three fertilization passes with rubicon 9000 when field stages change, hopefully I'll manage, it would not be nice to have 66% fertilization or even less on your crop.
</p>

<p>
Guess I'll stick with my normal routine that do full fertilization before seeding, its the most relaxed way as there is always plenty of time to get it done as opposed to the time sensitive post seeding fertilization stage change monitoring.

Returned leased lexion 8900 combine with the header, I don't need the header and while perhaps I could have used the combine with header lease for the corn field, its still growing so I'm not going to bleed off money with leasing waiting for the corn to be harvest ready.
</p>

<p>
Drove claas lexion 8900 to the dealership, dropped off midwest durus 18m header there, went to gas station and filled her up, then came to dealership and attached capello quasar hs16 corn header. Now its ready for the corn harvest on F81.
</p>

<p>
1.888m liters of soybeans in the farm bin silo now, if we could sold all of that with 3750 market prices it would make us 7.080m heh. Cant wait for next years soybeans best selling day, we are going to make some money.

Then I needed to take a break to check out new version of PMC Texas Rowena 8km and do tipCol test in 8km terrain for SinisterSockz. First I parked big bud 747 with bourgault 3420-100 paralink hoe drill into F80 and unfolded it, now its ready for next seeding.

Canola double cropping has been completed. Corn in F81 is still growing. Alright things are looking nice, lets just hope the canola will manage to be harvest ready before winter kills it off.
</p>

<p>
Now fertilization... yeah, NONE of my fields have now ANY fertilization hehe. So I need to start running that big old rubicon 9000 around a lot, then also few fields are needing lime, again I recall and assume its still possible to spread lime even after seeding. Not sure how I can manage to get three growth stage switches on all fields except the lime ones (they need two) in order for me to get all the fertilizer to the ground. Lets get started.

First stage of fertilization is done, some weed patches already popped up. Would be nice to spray the weeds but you cant see where you sprayed because the field color is now dark/wet from this fertilizer spraying heh. Oh well we move to lime spreading and wait for germination to happen which changes field color again.
</p>

<p>
Attempted to spread lime to the fields that need it... but it would not stick, apparently you cannot lime after seeding. I never tried it so had no idea, oh well learned something new today. So now I have F01, F04, F06, F07, F12 and F13 that need lime, that takes away some yield from my canola. This canola double cropping was a slight mistake, should have done it the right way going through all the fields with fert and cultivating etc for full 100% fertilizing state.
</p>

<p>
Next it was time accelerating until germination happen so I can fertilize spray some more, assuming it works in the germination stage heh I think it will :)

Thinking back about yesterday the decision to double crop canola right after harvest without any field work preparations, that was a big mistake. I just simply got greedy in my farming enthusiasm. Never get greedy or be in a hurry, always do proper meticulous field work before seeding your fields. Whats the point of farming if you're doing a half measure work like skipping fertilization.
</p>

<p>
It was really refreshing lesson to learn that you cannot spread lime after seeding, now I'm suffering the result of lower yield in canola then. Well today I'm continuing farming and trying my best to work on the fields as much as I can do with the above limitations. With rubicon 9000 "row crop" tires and field growth stage changes I should be able to fertilize full three stages 100% status, it just needs careful monitoring of those stages and immediate work when stage has changed.
</p>

<p>
No more half measures :)

Made a decision... Midwest Horizon v1.3.1 gives 30FPS so while spending my time on 30FPS inducing terrain I might as well do it on PMC terrains with huge fields large scale farming, so I am going to finish this harvest and then giving this career a long pause.
</p>

<p>
I need to switch over to editing terrains anyways, it just feels like wasted time when I'm not playing even on PMC terrains making videos out of them and getting valuable play-testing done. Terrain editing wise its like double waste of time for me.
</p>

<p>
So now my focus is to finish field work, wait for canola to be harvest ready, harvest it, park my vehicles and then give this savegame a rest.

Herbicide spraying is complete, weeds are gone. Next is last stage of fertilizing and for that I need to time accelerate until next stage of growth is switched.

</p>

<p>
Corn market price at 2208hrs is 1532. At 2306hrs its 1539. 04/mid-winter in-game 0011hrs corn market price is 1545. At 0109hrs its 1540 so price decreasing. Make a good note: best market selling price is always at the designated day just after 0000hrs midnight, do not time accelerate/wait until much after that, start hauling the grain at midnight, in the darkness, have that courseplay course ready to go heh.

Regarding canola double cropping, it was completely my mistake as I did it on 03/early-autumn which means any canola seeded at autumn goes to NEXT YEARS harvest season, my assumption was that I get to harvest them this year, I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
No big deal its just different time to seed it and huge time to wait until its harvest ready, I'd just like to keep stuff within the same year I mean I rather seed in spring anyways so double croppping to next year feels somehow odd to me, aaanyways. For FS19 in-game use (err what else there is? haha) it just means 9 full days to 6000 speed time acceleration through the spring. Well time accelerate and do the third stage of fertilization when growth stage switches.

Budget now 887.4k and I already paid off the 75k bank loan which was taken for fertilizer and herbicide purchases. That is pretty nice sum of money, I could buy some land but thats not my goal now, all I want to do is to harvest this canola and exit from this Start From Zero career for hopefully a long time.
</p>

<p>
We continue time accelerating until fertilizing becomes possible. But I realized on 05/mid-winter in-game 0850hrs that weather is -5/-2C so hmm fertilizing is not possible when ground is frozen, ah right, so we wait until spring time when ground becomes available for working.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0756hrs welcome to a new farming year! New year new season etc, yeeah. Also at the same time ground is not frozen anymore weather 4/2C and third growth stage switched into my canola fields. Lets start fertilizing them, again.

<p>
Final fertilization field work done, now all fields got 100% fertilization. Too bad about the few fields having lime issues but heh what can you do (well, proper field work haha). Felt good to have this task done. Unfortunately it was very late at the day, I did took that nap but I was expecting that any moment/hour now I'll get tired and have to stop playing. I was hoping one of those insomnia nights that I could press on playing for hours like 18-20hrs etc.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to finish this canola harvest and then with good "memory" (eh difficult to explain) save the game, backup it and then take a long break from this savegame while I edit and only play on PMC terrains. But that might be not possible, the harvest lasts for hours and hours for all the fields and would be amazing if I could stay up that long, so it might be tomorrow when I get to sign off here. But hey, I'll try...
</p>

<p>
After I took claas lexion 8900 to pickup the normal grain header I parked it to my farm area, then time acceleration begun to field getting harvest ready state.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 0623hrs canola harvest season has begun, crops are still growing. Decided to purchase another combine because the upcoming harvest will be dreadfully slow with only one.
</p>

<pre>
- harvester claas lexion 8900 18k liter with guidance steering 504.5k
- header 12m corn capello quasar hs16 90k
- header 18m midwest durus with colors 169.4k
</pre>
<p>
0820 Purchased the above setup, budget now 84.1k.
</p>

<p>
Canola is ready to harvest, aayeah lets begin! Funnily I just started to feel tired on my eyes which means I don't have much time left until the real yawns begin, well ok perhaps few hours dunno. But I'll continue as long as my eyes keep open, I really want to get this harvest done.
</p>

<p>
0827 Started harvesting canola F77, courseplay ETA 1h 16min, 2x tools<br>
0843 First yawn, this is not promising heh<br>
0909 Hardware glitch, had to reboot Gaming computer
</p>

<p>
After that hardware glitch when I started FS19 and loaded this savegame, date was 01/early-spring 0640hrs, but everything else seem to be OK. Err how did the seasons date reset all of the sudden?
</p>

<p>
Very odd as seasons shows now weather 3/16C, eh a bit broken weather system we currently have. Everything else in the savegame looks to be OK, I cant find anything out of the ordinary, it just somehow resetted the days to zero so to speak.
</p>

<p>
0945 Way too tired, had to shut it down...
</p>

<p>
1802 After a good nights sleep back at FS19, now we finish this canola harvest, possibly sell some grain and then put this savegame on long break.
</p>

<p>
I'm feeling great, a lot of motivation to finish this harvest and conclude this part of Start From Zero career for this terrain. Looking forward for editing terrains again. A lot of motivation, this harvest will be done in no time, I'll be doing the usual ALT-TAB to watch youtube videos/twitch streams but try to maintain no delays in my harvest. I am going to get this done, as quickly as possible.

<p>
Great feeling to finish that canola harvest, not only the usual sense of accomplishment on finishing harvest but because my goal now is to stop playing this savegame and continue editing. But before I stop anything I will sell all the canola and soybeans, I want them moneyz ;)
</p>

<p>
Even though at worst case scenario I'm never going to play this savegame again (yikes!?) I still drove all the vehicles back to my farm yard by F77 and F78, parked them all nicely lined up there for the winter.
</p>

<p>
Found one header width patch of canola from F78 which I combined away heh while another combine was driving back to the farm yard. Unloaded last canola from fendt 1050 pulled elmers haulmaster into farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo now has canola 1.274m and soybeans the same old 1.888m liters. Hmm ok thats odd, why do I have more soybeans than canola? Did the fields that needed lime really reduce the yield that much, sounds pretty unbelievable. Or did I already have some soybeans before the harvest, heh I cant remember that far back :)
</p>

<p>
Next we time accelerate until soybeans best market price selling day arrives, thats 04/mid-summer, then canola market price skyrockets 09/late-autumn to 01/early-winter.
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer in-game 2306hrs soybeans market price 3764. At 0004hrs its 3786. Decided to start selling, unfortunately selling point is at coopers farm grain on long way other side of the terrain.

<p>
1758 New farming day started, back in grain selling
</p>

<p>
I feel quite frustrated even at fresh new day starting because Start From Zero Midwest Horizon was supposed to be wrapped up was it like THREE days ago now and I'm still here, still playing... its like farmsim game is this mean nasty bitch where there are no escape from ;)
</p>

<p>
Indeed I should be editing terrains, play testing only PMC terrains... not wasting my time playing "just for fun", damn these first world problems I'm having :)

</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer in-game 0508hrs I can see sun coming over the horizon but ground is still shrouded in darkness (its still dark), I have been hauling soybeans ALL NIGHT, this is crazy..
</p>

<p>

1919 Sold soybeans in cooper farms grain for 255.3k, only 68.2k liters
</p>

<p>
Soybeans has been sold, farm bin silo has no stock left. Oh wow this selling speed took forever, just insane amounts of time. Started in-game about 0100hrs and now its in-game 0550hrs, uuh... FS19 is a time sink, did I ever tell you that?
</p>

<p>
Well sure, get more trucks... of course, that is an option. I was thinking of buying second truck as it would cut down this hauling time. Even getting an another trailer with a dolly to this truck, but as odd as it sounds Midwest Horizon feels too small for such "road train" truck trailer setup, at least to me it would feel uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Next we have 1.274m liters of canola to sell, best market price will be at 09/late-autumn and 01/early-winter it seems, so we are looking at some time accelerating.
</p>

<p>
Bizarre thing is that more time it takes to sell this grain... the more I feel like continuing playing, sort of eyeballing what lands to buy next and then starting to field work on them, heh. That would be bad ;)
</p>

<p>
I decided that hell with the money, next grain sales goes definitely to horizion coop which is just a minute or less away from my farm bin silo, I am not going to do these 10 minute (dunno but feels like it, or more) round trips to cooper farmers grain other side of the terrain anymore.
</p>

<p>
Topped up the gas tank on my truck. Budget now 7.205m oh wow seven million and that was just the soybeans, still canola to sell. Soon I get to buy whole Midwest Horizon hehe!
</p>

<p>
01/early-winter in-game 0004hrs canola market price is 2254 which is good, its 2273 in cooper farms grain but that is so far away and price difference so small that obviously I'm going to haul to horizion coop.
</p>

<p>
Started to haul canola to horizion coop, gimme that money. Actually felt really tired again sleep wise, did not get proper hours of sleep last night so now the tired mode activated, lost all energy to do anything. But I'll try to struggle through this grain sell.

Parked my grain truck all nicely along with other vehicles, then time accelerated to 01/early-winter in-game 0949hrs... and then... then I didn't know what to do. Just idled in discord and watched my old <a href="" target="_blank">Start From Scratch FS17 Cornbelt</a> career videos.

<p>
0155 Shut down FS19, time to take a long PMC terrain editing and play testing break from Star From Zero Midwest Horizon...
</p>

<!-- 2021-02-02 story ending -->
<!-- after 2020-04-07 game-play -->
	<h2>The Return 2021</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-01-19T0355</b> After a long break from this savegame, we're back!
</p>

<p>
Its been roughly 10 months since I played in Midwest Horizon Start From Zero the last time, that is a quite long down time. I did actually load this savegame up after precision farming release and was thinking about continuing, but gave up on the idea and continued on PMC Grande Gardens 16km instead.
</p>

<p>
I am not exactly sure how much will I play, hey who knows maybe I get bored really quick and go back to editing etc, but as of the moment of writing this I'm cautiously hopeful that I could press on hard for few days to make some real progress on this savegame. The final goal is to finish one more savegame. Currently I have PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero and this savegame active / unfinished, I won't be starting new ones before these are finished.
</p>

<p>
Did a quick check on mod versions, seasons is v1.3.1, seasons midwest GEO is v2.0.1 and courseplay is v6.03.00025 so those are all up to date.
</p>

<p>
Plan was also to continue NOT making videos/livestreams as I prefer to only do PMC terrain content (plenty of other people create good Midwest Horizon videos/streams) and to take a lot of screenshots for terrain editing inspiration and research purposes.
</p>

<p>
Was actually excited to launch this savegame after this long 10 months (with the exception of that quick precision farming attempt). I wanted to add some new mods, had few in mind but decided to get this show on the road with the existing mod-set first, there will be plenty of time to think about new mods when doing long field work :)
</p>

<p>
0415 Finally started up FS19, okay lets see what this savegame is all about. This savegame has 251hrs in it now.
</p>

<p>
First I had to get my bearings, this HTML page work file had some notes commented out which I went through, that included field work list TODO so to peak. Seasons is on 24 day mode, it might be a bit overkill for 4km terrain but its fine, we are currently in harvest season.
</p>

<p>
02/early-winter weather +2/+3C and forecast clear for the next few days.
</p>

<p>
We got list to harvest F19, F55, F56 soybeans and F50 canola. First I drove single claas lexion 8900 combine with midwest durus 18m header into F19.
</p>

<p>
Midwest Horizon with my game.xml lod view distance settings of 5 gave me solid 30FPS performance so I decided to reset to game default values, kind of hoping Txzar had optimized terrain for those so I would get a bit better performance.
</p>

<p>
So I resetted settings to max you can get from options menu, they are: viewDistanceCoeff 2, lodDistanceCoeff 2, foliageViewDistanceCoeff 2 and volumeMeshTessellationCoeff 0.5. However after restarting FS19 the performance was 30FPS flat, no change. Oh well, I'll keep these values in just incase it would be any help somewhere else around this terrain.
</p>

<p>
Soil is wet cannot harvest, time accelerating until it dries up. In-game 1800hrs night has falled, soil is wet, so skipping the night.

03/early-winter in-game 0848hrs, weather -2/+2C and forecast predicts zero drying potential until tomorrow. In-game 1532hrs soil is dry! Lets harvest some soybeans! :)
</p>

<p>
0456 Started harvesting soybeans F19, manual driving using GPS<br>
0505 Finished harvesting soybeans F19
</p>

<p>
What a tiny field this 19 was heh, almost too small for one 18m header, absolute overkill for courseplay even with single vehicle. Got 9760 liters of soybeans off from F19.
</p>

<p>
Next field to go was F55 all the way in the north, did a quick fly camera overview and there is no way I can drive 18m wide header combine up there, I need to buy a header trailer.
</p>

<pre>
- midwest durus header trailer 60ft 22.5k
</pre>

<p>
Bought the above times two. Budget now 119.5k. Used Fendt 1050 to pickup header trailers, brought one to our farm and drove second to the F19 combine location.
</p>

<p>
0528 Started harvesting soybeans F55, manual driving using GPS<br>
0531 Finished harvesting soybeans F55
</p>

<p>
This field was even smaller, one headland and like 75% done hehe. Then it was time to move combine to F56. Then took Fend 1050 with elmers haulmaster grain cart and drove it to F56 combine and unloaded the combine. Was looking at the F56 size and its another tiny one, it might be okay to do with single vehicle courseplay but because I'm enthusiastic to play I'm really happy to do it manually using GPS, this also takes every single soybean plant off the field.
</p>

<p>
0540 Started harvesting soybeans F56, manual driving using GPS<br>
0551 Finished harvesting soybeans F56
</p>

<p>
Well that went by quickly heh. I'm just coming off from PMC Grande Gardens 16km massive harvests so doing these small fields is hilarious, very refreshing so not ridiculing them or anything.
</p>

<p>
Checked F50 but it was still growing, I assume this is like winter canola double cropping, so that field is off the todo list.
</p>

<p>
Then drove Fendt 1050 to farm recording courseplay course, sent combine after. Then went with combine to pickup corn header from the dealership, now the whole farm vehicle fleet was in the farm.
</p>

<p>
This concludes harvest season. Then it was time to start working fields for next season, drove Big Bud 747 with Flexicoil ST820 to F21.
</p>

<p>
0631 Started cultivating F21, courseplay ETA 14min<br>
</p>

<p>
Drove massey ferguson 7726 with bredal k165 lime spread setup to F83. Refueled it by the gas station which reminds me that I need to buy pickup truck with FST990 fuel trailer because our vehicles do need fuel out in the boonies. I don't think small terrain like 4km requires big semi truck tanker, so I'll at least start with the small pickup truck trailer.
</p>

<p>
0642 Started lime spreading F83, courseplay ETA 24min<br>
0647 Finished cultivating F21
</p>

<p>
Next field was so small I decided its easier and quicker to just do it manually using GPS instead of courseplay which takes forever in the turns, plus I like GPS driving on small terrains ;)
</p>

03/early-winter in-game 1747hrs night had fallen, time accelerated until morning daylight.
</p>

<p>
04/early-winter in-game 0745hrs, gooood mooorning Midwest Horizon! Weather 0/+2C and forecast predicts, well who really cares when doing field work other than seeding and harvesting ;)
</p>

<p>
F26 was covered with a fence, this fence obviously had a very narrow gate which must be opened. I tried to eyeball it but it looked too narrow for Big Bud 747 to go through but I decided to try anyways just in case. But no dice, Big Bud 747 can be wiggled just barely through the fence with heavy geometry collision (undrealistic) but flexicoil st820 will get stuck there.
</p>

<p>
Someone might say "well use smaller equipment", really? That's your solution, wow... so I'm supposed to buy a smaller vehicle just for one (possibly one dunno if there are more) field, hehe noway man.
</p>

<p>
So I scrapped this F26 off the board, it wont be counted into "harvest all fields" goal. Okay, next field!
</p>

Brought Rubicon 9000 down to SE area and work alongside with the lime spreader, first fertilizer then lime and then again fertilizer, this gives me two layers of fertilization with ease.

<p>
0831 I was starving, had to get some chow... then came back all feeded up and ready to continue.
</p>

<p>
I must say that now I have some sort of hasty rush feeling that I just want the press on hard to finish this savegame, not because I love cultivating or fertilizing etc field work, but simply because I want to finish <i>a savegame</i> (this one). I feel that this sort of reason why to play is kind of bad on the long run, if you don't play to enjoy... why do it. Hmm Hmm...
</p>

<p>
While three courseplay courses were running I had some time to think... that F26 blocked off by fence is troubling issue, its not only that I wanted to drive mega cultivator there, you cant drive even small combine with header there. You can drive combine there with header on header trailer... but then you destroy crops during hooking up the header, so yeah... field blocked by fence is just unacceptable.
</p>

Cultivating existing low paying crops under is complete. Still has huge list of fields to lime spread and fertilize. Then of course herbicide spray but I think that will be something after seeding on first growth stage (germinated?).

1049 Started fertilizing F07, courseplay ETA 8min
</p>

<p>
Here we had our first boring moment, had nothing to watch in twitch or youtube and was just waiting for courseplay to finish fertilizing. Should have drove that manually with GPS to have at least something to do. Felt more and more impatient, not exactly frustrated but getting really close to that mood, that I only wanted to get this savegame done and it felt like progressing so slowly heh.
</p>

<p>
Stopped rubicon under courseplay and continued driving with GPS myself ;)
</p>

<p>
1057 Finished fertilizing F07<br>

1108 Finished fertilizing F22
</p>

<p>
Attempted to spread lime on F22 which had withered, corn I believe, and of course it didn't s tick. Okay lets break out Big Bud 747 and Flexicoil ST820 again. Hmm I might as well move these guys now in three vehicle fleet from field to field just to avoid situations like that and also if there is cultivating required to have third layer of fertilization in, then again saves time as vehicles don't have to zip around the terrain that much.
</p>

<p>
1116 Started cultivating F22, courseplay ETA 23min
</p>

<p>
And again as I had nothing else to do I cancelled courseplay course and drove rest of it myself using GPS. Courseplay is great when you have multiple vehicles working or you go grab a bite to eat etc on the background, but if you just sit there watching courseplay drive your vehicle... its like, why. Heh.
</p>

<p>
1141 Finished cultivating F22<br>

<p>
Now I sort of got bored and demoralized looking at the number of fields I need to care for before I even get to planting season, I mean its basically half of the terrains fields heh. So I decided to do a nasty naughty thing... I'll just time accelerate until planting season and start to drill down soybeans with that big bourgault air drill not caring about fertilizing or weeds etc. I'm sure with the amount of fields I got there will be enough cash coming from the harvest to buy rest of the terrain, hopefully.
</p>

<p>
Dunno man, I just don't have energy to meticulously care for these fields until end of days, I just want to finish this savegame and be done with it. Yes I know, I'm no good farmer hehe ;)
</p>

<p>
So time acceleration until next years planting season begins now. Oh btw I got 86.4k budget and buying seeds for all these fields... yeah I have to take a bank loan, for sure.
</p>

<p>
17/late-winter in-game 0945hrs, weather -4/-1C its snowing.
</p>

<p>
1602 Reached new season, decided to restart FS19 to clear memory etc as its been running all day.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0851hrs, weather +2/-1C. Alright lets fill up bourgault air drill with seeds before we continue time accelerating to the planting season. Going to take 70k liter trailer full of seeds which probably brings my budget close to zero. On next refill I need to take a bank loan then.
</p>

<p>
17/late-spring in-game 0735hrs, weather +3/+9C and forecast doesn't predict anything below +10C so once soil warms up we start to put soybeans into the ground. Finally. Uuh so much time accelerating hehe.
</p>

<p>
18/late-spring in-game 0627hrs planting season starts now.
</p>

<p>
1646 Started seeding soybeans F77, manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Decided to do this first field with manual driving as its so nice to roll with Big Bud 747 pulling monster Bourgault 3420-100 Paralink Hoe Drill ;)
</p>

<p>
Probably going to switch to courseplay when next large field comes along, smaller ones need to be done with GPS as its such a mess trying to use equipment of this size on a small field. Actually... there are some fields which I have use that great plains planter to fit in. We'll see.
</p>

<p>
Oh and I want to only seed big fields to make money, easy seeding and harvesting, big whole sale bulk ;)
</p>

<p>
Looks like the biggest fields I own are in order of being closest to farm yard; F77 (seeding it now), F78, F81, F08, F04, F11, then going to north, F69, F62, F64.. eh well there are several when you start to count. Its clear that I cant get other than started today, this will take some time hehe.

Decided to bring massey ferguson 7726 to pull great plains planter to help seed soybeans into those smaller fields, even though the main work horse is bourgault air drill. Great plains planter of course does not cultivate, so I need to plug Flexicoil ST820 into Big Bud 450 and cultivate first, not sure if I'm going to do great many fields like this, but maybe few near the farm yard area.

Had to refill rubicon 9000, she was running out of fertilizer juice. Our farm yard is so close it was piece of cake to drive there and back to F11, but yeah it would be nice to have semi truck tanker hauling fertilizer (and fuel) around. Speaking of which big bud 450 has only 16% fuel left.

Yesterday felt quite guilty of choosing this course of action to just spam seed soybeans without caring much about plowing, fertilizing, liming and herbicide spraying... but today I'm good with it, have no shame to just get the job done, harvest a lot of fields and make some money. It was just so depressing to see that volume of work I was facing if I had cared all the owned fields, not to mention in the future when I buy the west side lands of this terrain.

Uuuh list gets long as fields are getting done heh. When moving bourgault 3420-100 air drill to the next field I had to fold it up as the utility poles were so close together that the drill didn't fit in between them. Was looking at F14 shape and decided that yeah this one will be GPS only due how narrow parts it has, courseplay would have a hard time getting this job done.

Zoomed out on mapview a bit, saw that I have now seeded about 20-25% of the terrains fields, a bit less than half of my owned fields. That again demoralized me because I was already quite hmm exhausted, bored, dunno what terminology to use, for this planting season. Hard facts are that there is no "get it done quickly" in farmsim, not even in 4km terrain.
</p>

I just felt like yep I'm gonna grab something to eat and also shut down PMC Gaming computer for today, enough playing gotta do something else for a while.

F62 was annoying as rubicon 9000 (and I assume bourgault 3420-100) is too wide for the narrow parts so courseplay cannot generate course. So had to drive this one manually using GPS, always fun.

Now I was seeding the last field, felt good. Okay F63 and F46 are fairly square and good sizes but I don't think I'll be doing those now. Also this wasn't all the new fiels bought, just biggest and easiest to field work on. There was several fields which were small or locked behind fences or river creek beds which I leave for future seasons, I just want to get this done now and make some money.
</p>

<p>
Looks like it wont take a long time now before can time accelerate until harvest season, although I do want to fertilize and possibly herbicide spray if I can along with the time acceleration. Its just so annoying to drive into a field and find out that ok still cannot spray it, for that reason I want to do spraying before seeding. Anyways we'll do it if it doesn't get annoying.
</p>

<p>
And then lateron get to start soybeans harvest, that of course will last for couple of days at least. Or dunno how quickly I can knock these fields off from the list using two claas lexion 8900s with midwest durus 18m headers which are fairly decent size for a small 4km terrain. We'll see.

Alright on quick glance to mapview now we don't have anything to fertilize until next field stage change, I believe germination switch should allow us to fertilize again.

Then starts time accelerating, hopefully only one day until fields are germinated and we could possibly continue fertilizing some more. Few fields are already 100% but there are plenty of 33% ones.

1100 Started fertilizing F77, manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Opening field was shaped such way which created very inefficient courseplay course so decided to save time and drive this myself. I enjoy driving with GPS on small terrains / fields. Bulk of my farming time is spent in large terrains on huge fields using courseplay, you really get alienated feeling when you do such farming for weeks and months on end.

<p>
Ran out of fertilizer on the first pass, needed to go refill at farm yard. After that I got stuck in a fence and had to reset vehicle to shop. When doing that it reset also fertilizer thank and repair to ZERO, not only that but variable spray rate setting to MAX.
</p>

<p>
1524 Ran out of fertilizer, again... because I didn't realize variable spray rate was set to MAX. Sigh.<br>
1533 Finished fertilizing F62
</p>

<p>
20/late-spring in-game 0742hrs, weather +13/+12C. Seems like another field stage switch happened so I can continue fertilize spraying. But that have to wait until grabbing bite to eat, I'm starving...

<p>
Here I am still fertilizing, still in planting season... did I write earlier today that I'm hoping to start harvesting today, yeah fat chance on that as its already so late in the day for me and still several fields to fertilize last stage. After that... if I wanted full yield, would be herbicide spraying but no way I'm doing that anymore.

<p>
All done! planting season is a wrap! ;)
</p>

<p>
Not sure how many hours do I have left in this day, still not feeling tired, so I'm going to start time accelerating towards harvest season. Had to go refuel second claas lexion 8900 as it was 17% fuel state. While doing so was feeling that eyes do feel tired so we don't have much time left and I'd hate to start harvest season on first field and then have to leave it unfinished because bed time heh.
</p>

<p>
Sent semi truck to sell 31.4k liters of soybeans which we harvested from those fields we bought last season. Its not going to be much, but some change money at least.
</p>

<p>
1932 Sold 31.4k soybeans in cooper farms grain for ... dunno, tipper trailer clipped with the building and all kinds of geometry havoc happened, anyways budget now 117.4k. Paid all of it to bank loan, still 90k bank loan left.
</p>

<p>
Okay now I'm getting so tired on my eyes that its better to call it a night here. Been great day seeding and fertilizing for sure, next time we play is going to be a bit more time accelerating and then we kick off harvest season.
</p>

<p>
1938 Shut down FS19, good night...
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-22T1248</b> New farming day has started, a bit late but still, today we harvest! This savegame now has 283hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
So more time accelerating until we are in harvest season. Combines are all ready to go. I could herbicide spray... but nah, I don't think the weeds reduce our yield that much that I would care for now, I just want to harvest and get some money and then buy more land ;)
</p>

<p>
02/early-autumn in-game 0755hrs, boom soybeans are ready to harvest, lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
First obviously had to setup semi truck grain haul course to farm bin silo, I don't think I have one for F77 because its right next to the farm yard heh.
</p>

<p>
1318 Started harvesting soybeans F77, courseplay ETA 1h 11min, 2x tools<br>
1458 Finished harvesting soybeans F77<br>
1459 Started harvesting soybeans F76, manually, one tool<br>
1509 Finished harvesting soybeans F76<br>
1511 Started harvesting soybeans F74, courseplay ETA min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Second combine fell into river and got stuck there, it was just one of these cliche FS19 rage inducing moments trying to get that frigging thing out of the river. I finally got combine alone out of the river but header was still floating across river. I knew it would be easy to reset header to the shop... but no way in hell I'm taking header trailer and go pick it up from there FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN DUMB GEOMETRY ISSUE. So yeah, GRRR! :x
</p>

<p>
Finally after painstaking battle with geometries I got that sumbitch out of the river, harvest continues but my mood is faul...
</p>

<p>
1558 Finished harvesting soybeans F74
</p>

<p>
Shut down FS19 for "lunch break".
</p>

<p>
1630 FS19 back up, harvest continues<br>
1633 Started harvesting soybeans F75, courseplay ETA 30min, 2x tools<br>

? Finished harvesting soybeans F66<br>
1824 Started harvesting soybeans F69, manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Yeah F69 is so badly shaped with the creek bed that courseplay just cant generate anykind of sane course, so I decided to drive this old school way manually with GPS. Yes takes twice as long, but what can you do. Not even headland was done yet and I already hated this field for being such bad shape.
</p>

<p>
Being bored GPS harvesting was thinking that if there are any other fields which wont work okay I need to drive and record courseplay outline course for the field, it doesn't matter if the outline is smaller than whole field, at least it gets harvested normal speed and after its done then you can go and cut those problem spots manually. There is no point harvesting using GPS when another combine is just standing idle by edge of the field.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Then it was time to call it a night, was not a full day of farming but at least something, got nice amount of fields done.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-23T0313</b> Back at farming, this savegame now has 290hrs in it. Today we continue harvest, what else.
</p>

<p>
First recorded outline for F62 because it has one such narrow spot that not even one midwest durus 18m header fits there not to mention two.

<p>
Soybeans in farm bin silo 1.245 million liters, even if I missed some lime spreading and herbicide spraying, the yields are pretty good from all these fields and this was basically only the northern sector, still have bunch of southern fields to do.
</p>

<p>

Both lexions are low on fuel so had to drive them to the gas station one by one, also took more bank loan to buy the fuel.
</p>

<p>
0724 Started harvesting soybeans F81, courseplay ETA 55min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Just minutes after starting this field I got hungry and really wanted to take a break to eat.
</p>

<p>
0757 Feeding break is over, lets continue harvesting some soybeans<br>
0856 Finished harvesting soybeans F81

</p>

<p>
Half way through this field I got so tired I was snoozing off all the time, was difficult time to keep myself awake to finish F08, so now that its done I have to go take a nap which pisses me off as it will shift my sleeping cycle a lot again which is further difficulties for next week, hrr. Anyways back to farming after a refreshing nap.
</p>

<p>
Well could not sleep longer than 45min (if even that), back to farming.

<p>
Still had some energy left to play but only few hours remaining in this day before bedtime (yeah long story but I want to keep regular sleep cycle now until early next week), so decided to leave last three fields for tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-24T0406</b> Back at PMC Gaming, today we finish this harvest season. This savegame now has 304hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
These three remaining fields will be done in no time. Cant wait to get this harvest season wrapped up.
</p>

<p>
0417 Started harvesting soybeans F22, courseplay ETA 22min, 2x tools<br>
0443 Finished harvesting soybeans F22<br>
0446 Started harvesting soybeans F92, courseplay ETA 32min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
After days first meal I started PMC Gaming computer and continued this savegame, when F92 was about 70% done I felt like now finally my gaming day officially starts as I got all the little things done that you do while getting started playing (difficult to explain). What I mean is almost two fields done and feels like I just started, this will be a good farming day as I get to sell soybeans so quickly.
</p>

<p>
? Finished harvesting soybeans F92<br>
0536 Started harvesting soybeans F14, courseplay ETA ?min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
Again forgot to write two finish/start times down heh sorry about that. Had some odd chats going on in discord, I should actually reduce my discord activity by like ... a lot, more than half, probably like 90% to be honest. Oh well, pay attention when farming ;)
</p>

<p>
0629 Finished harvesting soybeans F14
</p>

<p>
Harvest season is complete! Whohooo! :-)
</p>

<p>
Then it was just driving all the vehicles back to farm yard. After harvest season is complete its nice to just drive direct line from A to B without using roads as all fields are free to roam. Sure its not exactly realistic as you wouldn't drive trucks that much across fields, I mean even a smallest dried up creek bed or water way could get semi truck stuck. Also driving combines with midwest durus 18m headers in Midwest Horizon terrain roads... yeah they would get stuck on utility poles, fences and whatnot very quickly.
</p>

<p>
0638 Combines arrived to farm yard and were parked for the winter, harvest season is officially over ;)
</p>

<p>
This harvest season got our farm 3.033 million liters of soybeans :)
</p>

<p>
Then I started time accelerating until the next season so we can sell soybeans at high price. Now this is kind of tricky... it would sort of skip one season if I'm just going to sell soybeans now to see how much money I get that how many land lots I get to buy. My burning desire right now is to sell soybeans and buy land, I don't want to start another planting season. But yeah, lets make some money now.
</p>

<p>
It was 05/early-autumn just endless amount of days left in this season... I decided to sort of cheat, well not really but yeah... I'll change seasons days to 3, which makes this go by really quickly. The only thing is that hmm wonder how the highest selling day changes with so short season hmm, maybe I need to bring it back up to normal 24 when the season switches.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring with 3 day season, lets get to soybeans highest selling day and start to sell.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer (3 day season!) in-game 0056hrs soybeans price 3367 horizion coop. I'll list the prices with time and price below here in one big blob, just for future reference and knowledge.
</p>

<p>
In-game times: 0339hrs 3417, 0630hrs 3467, 0935hrs 3492, 1230hrs 3518, 1530hrs 3602, 1834hrs 3668, 2132hrs 3718. Okay 3.7k market price is pretty good for me already, I'm going to time accelerate 600 speed near midnight and then start to haul some grain. 2205hrs 3735, 2303hrs 3751, 2356hrs 3751 okay lets start hauling to cooper farms grain.
</p>

<p>
To save text space the following is sold 70k liters of soybeans on cooper farms grain sell point and market price is 3768. Cooper farms grain is the sell point far away in SW sector of this terrain, so it takes a long time to drive there and back. Horizion coop which is right next to our farm has much lower soybeans market price currently, hopefully that changes soon and we can switch there.
</p>

<p>
I am really bored, its insane how long does it take just to do this farming task, to sell grain. Its quite long way for one selling loop and its only 70k liters per trip, selling 3 million liter takes a while even with two trucks. But this is farmsim, its such a time sink and sitting here fiddling my thumbs doing nothing while trucks loop endlessly... feels just so frustrating.
</p>

<p>
Off to eat lunch while trucks roll... I'm probably going to miss at least two trips.

0923 Lunch break is over, back to watching boring trucks roll by. I saw those above sell events, I think market prices dropped, they are now 3678, man do they come down quickly. Well ok not much but still, I mean how many trucks would we need to sell big grain storage, its not possible to sell much more than million or so liters before prices start to drop in seasons. Anyways, its still good money.

</p>

<p>
But yeah "whohoo" for you for taking from 0716hrs - 1125hrs, that is insane :(
</p>

<p>
Then saved game and started to purchase land. I did this without pre-planning, idea is to expand farm systematically out, every piece of land that has field in it will be bought until money runs out of the land heh. Here is the list:
</p>

<pre>
F30 282.6k
F38 224.5k
F37 and F36 357.7k
F33 92k
F25, F28 and F29 177.6k

F90 and more 672.7k
F94 292.3k
F98 138.6k
F109 501.3k
F31 134.2k
F32 and F34 357.8k
F42 1.104 million
F54 290.8k
F35 193k
F121 584.6k

F110 619.6k
F115 309.8k
F116 267.4k
F114 334.8k
</pre>

<p>
Budget 183.4k and then paid bank loan off so final budget 78.4k.
</p>

<p>
1139 Saved game and exited FS19, I want to add some mods and make a quick plan.
</p>

<p>
1215 FS19 back up, added Demco 42ft trailer, GtX seed cleaner (make seeds out of barley/wheat), shopsearch and vehicle speed sync.
</p>

<p>
Purchased demco 42ft trailer with realistic 40,000 liter total capacity (20k per hopper) for 45.2k
</p>

<p>
One of the fields purchased was F109 which is harvest ready wheat, perfect for our seed cleaner machine. Lets get to it.
</p>

<p>
1239 Had courseplay course for grain truck recorded all the way to F109
</p>

<p>
My heart just isn't into this savegame now, I'm simply running in this "lets finish this whatever it takes!" attitude. Yes sure I wanted to try that seed cleaner in action, but I had zero interest of starting an legit new planting season etc, I'll just harvest this wheat field or at least enough of it, then take another bank loan heh and purchase that seed cleaner and start doing my own seeds. Maybe later I get properly motivated again and start to put some heart and soul into this savegame, caring about fields like they should be.
</p>

<p>
Before even starting to harvest this wheat field I knew the yield will be terrible, it required lime and had NO fertilizer, and boy does it show heh, yield was just so bad, felt like my soybeans yield earlier was twice as much as this hehe.
</p>

<p>
1243 Started harvesting wheat F109, courseplay ETA 55min, 2x tools<br>
1340 Finished harvesting wheat F109
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then it was lunch time again. I shut down FS19 so I can eat in peace and precious 3 day (temporary) day time is not wasted heh.
</p>

<p>
1414 Started FS19 back up, lets get some seed cleaning going on.
</p>

<p>
Next step was to take a bank loan, seed cleaner costs 62k so I just took a 100k straight up as I need to buy the seed treatment chemical and some sort of wheel loader lease or something to carry those things into farm yard. Purchased and placed seed cleaner, then two 2k liter pallets of seed treatment chemical and finally leased claas torion 956 sinus and magsi pallet fork.
</p>

<p>
Then loaded pallets to wheel loader and ran them to our farm yard. Purchased additional two more 2k liter pallets and brought them to the seed cleaner as well, the cleaner only takes 4000 liters at one time so I placed these extra pallets to the trigger waiting to be used when needed. Then drove semi truck with demco grain trailer back to farm yard and started to load wheat from bin silo to the seed cleaner.
</p>

<p>
Got that done and seed cleaner was loaded with 4000 liters of treatment and 60,000 liters of wheat, it was maxed out 100% full. Now we just wait until it starts to produce seeds, its supposed to produce 3000 liters per hour.
</p>

<p>
First try on this seed cleaner on actual real savegame (I tried it out for errors and such on PMC Farm Lab), so far looking good, it was nice change of pace on usual farming activities. I'm just wondering... will this be just another mindless time sink on top of everything else in farmsim hmm, I mean when you buy seeds directly from giants buying station placeable, boom its done. But yeah its always magical feeling to plant with seeds which you produced yourself. So dunno really. We'll see...

1844 Started to rain! Weather forecast predicts rain until 2100hrs
</p>

<p>
Last pass was being harvested when it started to rain, noooo! hehe. So I unloaded the combines and send semi truck to haul that little canola it had on trailer to the farm bin silo. That amounted 229.7k liters of wheat and 67.4k liters of canola. That wheat will be nice seed cleaner filler for sure.
</p>

<p>
Looks like seed cleaner now has 12.5k liters of seeds already, nice.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to call it a night, was not tired yet but there is not much more I can achieve today.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-25T0255</b> Back to farming, this savegame now has 317hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Actually surprised that this savegame has that many hours already, when I finished PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km Farm Manager savegame that had less than three hundred.
</p>

<p>
Okay lets get to work, its now 02/mid-summer (3 day season, temporarily) in-game 1356hrs and its raining, forecast predicts rain until 2100hrs tonight.
</p>

<p>
Well... after time accelerating crops were wet, they only dried up at night time and when skipping the night then again more rain, crops are wet... this continued until harvest season was over. So I was in 02/mid-winter in-game 0954hrs, crops are wet and harvest season is over, crops withered. Luckily I only had one pass off canola left which is no big deal.
</p>

<p>
Seed cleaner with all this time accelerating had ran its course, all 60k liters of wheat have been treated into seeds, nicely done. Need to refill wheat when getting semi truck back to the farm yard.
</p>

<p>
Drove semi truck grain trailer back to farm yard, refilled seed cleaner, then drove combines and grain cart tractor back to farm yard. Our vehicle fleet has come home.
</p>

<p>
0332 Sold 40k liters of canola in horizion coop for 2*37.7k<br>
0335 Sold canola in horizion coop for 37.7k + 13.9k, budget now 51.7k
</p>

<p>
okay now harvest season is wrapped up, meaning this temporary 3 day action packed season config ;)
</p>

<p>
Decided to do one fertilizing contract, F119 for 61.3k reward.
</p>

<p>
0344 Started fertilizing F119, courseplay ETA 25min<br>
0410 Started lime spreading F77, courseplay ETA 1h 12min<br>
0412 Finished fertilizing F119 and collected reward 61.3k, budget now 98.8k<br>
0438 Started fertilizing F81, manually with GPS<br>
</p>

<p>
Hmm started F81 because lime spreading on F77 took so long, umm how did that happen, heh. What I mean is if your work takes a long time why would you start even more work. This fertilizing will finish much quicker than liming so it kind of passes the time, but overall point is that how did I end up doing field work, this was not what I had planned for todays early and brief farming session :)
</p>

<p>
Overall goal is the same, make some money by harvesting soybeans, but there is so much fertilizing to do and as seen with F77 there are some fields requiring lime as well. All this takes time, many many hours of field work. Then seeding... and the eventual harvest. We are clearly talking about DAYS instead of hours, yeah... I don't want to sign up for that, I need to go edit terrains or farming-simulator.org web code etc.
</p>

<p>
0454 Finished fertilizing F81
</p>

<p>
Checked land prices for the remaining that I don't own yet, it was 4.072 million. So wont be needing as large soybeans harvest as last time, but still fair amount of work to get that amount together.
</p>

<p>
0528 Finished lime spreading F77
</p>

<p>
Parked lime spreading tractor, saved game and exited FS19.
</p>

<p>
New farming day has started! ... err wait, no it isn't, this is still the same day! hehe, yup took most of the day break as I have some dreaded real life chores to take care of which sucked big time, but now I'm free to farm until bed time which is luckily several hours away still.
</p>

<p>
Alright so I was thinking while being away from this savegame that unfortunately there is no easy way to finish this, I just get frustrated if I try. So I'm going to now time accelerate until new season start and then set seasons length back to 24 days for that nice and relaxed game-play. Then I'll start to prepare fields, fortunately with this 3 day rush there is plenty of fields fallow now.
</p>

<p>
I want to lime and 100% fertilize fields, then seed soybeans on fallow ground using our new seed cleaner made seeds. I don't have to plant every field I own, not even close, just those biggest ones and that for sure generates enough revenue to allow me to buy all the remaining land lots in Midwest Horizon. That is this seasons goal.
</p>

<p>
Hmm was looking at my fields and they show legume (soybeans) as last planting, but yeah that is last years so once the season switches then all our fields are fallow and we can put in soybeans with good crop rotation.
</p>

<p>
Was eyeballing huge fields, looks like biggest fields in no particular order are F77, F81, F62, F42 and definitely the biggest is F108. I don't want to stretch my vehicle fleet too wide out, but that F108 definitely interests me as it would be quite large harvest. Its better to harvest one big field than three or four small ones.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm going to discard F62 from that list because its beyond one bridge, but so is F108, hmm hmm was hard to decide what to do, so I just went the usual thing, the big fields around my farm yard which is easy access for vehicles, I'll skip F08 as courseplay is so difficult on it, well I could of course record simpler outline but hmm.
</p>

<p>
Anyways I'll do a lime/fert list of fields now and get to work while this 3 day season still has one day left. Do few of those fields and then we get to start a brand new "proper" 24 day season again. Lets do it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-26T0447</b> Back at PMC Gaming, we continue preparations for the next season. This savegame now has 325hrs in it.

<p>
All field work done for what I had a plan, unless I missed some steps I cant fertilize more fields before cultivating or seeding. Drove vehicles back to farm yard, checked mapview and all fields need herbicide spraying as there are crazy weeds. But because all fields are supposed to be fertilized last time I cannot spray them again until cultivated, so we have to wait.
</p>

<p>
Okay time to switch into next season and 24 days seasons.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0731hrs, configured seasons as 24 day season. Okay lets continue playing the normal relaxed way heh.
</p>

<p>
Loaded seed cleaner with wheat, then hmm nothing much else to do before planting season and with soybeans its several days (now that I switched to 24 day season heh).
</p>

<p>
22/late-spring in-game 0806hrs, weather +12/+12C and forecast predicts one day with +9C lowest temperature but I don't think that causes any issues for our soybeans planting season. So I'll start big seeding operation now.

Got all the planned "good" fields seeded with soybeans, awesome. Now I'm hungry and exited FS19 for another lunch break...
</p>

<p>
1358 FS19 booted back up, lets continue wrapping up our planting season.
</p>

<p>
Parked fertilizing vehicles to fields which need another layer of fertilization, then as it was in-game 1501hrs I decided to straight up time accelerate until tomorrow morning so fields get germinated and we can start finishing up fertilizing them.
</p>

<p>
23/late-spring in-game 0618hrs, right after time accelerating and seasons sync our fields were still in planted stage, hmm. Better wait a bit and indeed minute or so later fields switched to germinated stage, we are good to go for fertilizing.

<p>
All fields 100% fertilized (plus limed and plowed), next is time accelerating until next field growth stage switches so we can start to herbicide spray them. But first I quickly go check which fields take spray product (can see from dry/wet color). Was surprised to find many fields ready for spraying, guess that overnight time acceleration did its thing.

Skipped the night into 24/late-spring in-game 0647hrs, some minute or so later field stage switched I could actually see it coming top down from north to south when it switched from wet to dry color. Okay lets do these last fields.

Uaah all done, planting season is a wrap! :)
</p>

<p>
I have one and a half hour of day left here, not that I have any bed time or anything but I like to keep a bit more regular sleeping cycle now, so I'm going to call it a night here because if I start harvesting now its difficult to let go when you need to shut it down, I just keep harvesting for hours hehe. Tomorrow harvest season begins, for sure, cant wait.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-27T0454</b> New day has started, this savegame now has 338hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Today is a harvest day, just need to time accelerate until harvest season and soybeans are. So I break out the combines, lined all of the harvest vehicle fleet next to F77 hoping it will be the first one ready (they are all at the same time it seems), I'm good to go just need to time accelerate until harvest ready field stage.
</p>

<p>
I love 24 day seasons but time accelerating between planting and harvest season really is... a lot of time just spent doing that, especially with larger terrains that sync dialog stays up sometimes for minutes which is brutal. Small 4km terrain could be done with 9 days, perhaps even less, but I like to keep it at max for that relaxed game-play.
</p>

<p>
One could argue that you can harvest all the small fields in ravenport new farmer starter location in the same time it takes to skip these extra seasons days like I'm doing right now, so yeah.
</p>

<p>

Harvesting here and already feel like I cant wait for this harvest to be over and get to sell the soybeans which most likely allows me to buy rest of the lands in Midwest Horizon. After that there is still plenty of field work to do before every field has been harvested, but once I own all the land that is a major milestone, then I get to take a break from this savegame again heh.

Recorded new courseplay semi truck grain hauling course for F108, even though it was mere 200-300m longer than one on F109, I just wanted to shave off that much grain cart driving. With field this size we are pulling so many grain loads out of it that any distance less in grain cart driving is a bonus.

</p>

<p>
Again awesome sense of accomplishment to finish a long harvest season.
</p>

<p>
I'm quite amazed that semi truck hauling grain with that puny 40,000 liter demco trailer can keep up with two combines. Yes that semi was often times running constantly, but never I got so overwhelmed that I'd have to wait for the truck to return. Clearly I need to buy second truck to ease the operations but yeah kind of surprised how smoothly this harvest season went. I'm sure when we switch to canola or corn we start to have some issues :)
</p>

<p>
Drove harvest vehicle fleet back to home base. unhooked combine headers and tucked combines away for the winter. Then drove massey ferguson great plains planter tractor and big bud 450 cultivator tractors to farm yard as well, now everyone is at home.
</p>

<p>
Then it was finally time to get ready for grain selling, which means time accelerating ... and again I'm realizing that okay its 03/early-autumn, there is still almost two full 24 day seasons to go even for end of the year. I'm going to switch again to 3 day seasons there is just no need to time accelerate through all these days for no reason.
</p>

<p>
This harvest season was done in two days so I might as well leave season length to 3 days until I ran out of time, dunno.
</p>

<p>
Soybeans harvest season got us 2.372 million liters of soybeans, pretty nice. This should give us enough money to purchase all the remaining lands in Midwest Horizon and actually I'm hoping there is some money left over so I can buy another truck and maybe some tractor as well.
</p>

<p>
Took semi truck and went to pickup FST990 fuel trailer, heh yeah a slight overkill but it was a fast vehicle so. Refueled both the semi and FST990.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer in-game 2323hrs, soybeans market price 3758 on horizion coop. Oh yeah we'll start selling some soybeans, lets make some money!
</p>

<p>
Going to do one load first to get budget into positive count, then lease hmm two more trucks and start really hauling volume.

<p>
Returned leased vehicles then time accelerated until morning light (I just find night time, err not pleasant).
</p>

<p>
Budget now 8.902 million, nicely done. Then <b>bought all the land with fields</b> and paid back bank loan, budget now 4.663 million. very nice! :)
</p>

<p>
So now I own all the land lots with fields in them, there are like 22-24 land lots without fields which I did not buy, because... why would I, some of them are just forests with trees that has no logging value, so no point buying them. First part of the savegame finishing goal is met, buy all the land :)
</p>

<p>
And 4.663 million budget allows me to buy all kinds of cool vehicles and implements, for example grain truck at least one, possibly two, although 4km terrain with field sizes as these doesn't really need three other than to sell grain fast.
</p>

<p>
Shut down FS19, I want to make list out of mapview screenshot of the fields I need to harvest before this savegame is can be finished.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-01-29T0611</b> Back at PMC Gaming, farming continues. This savegame now has 359hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Decided that I'm going for it... to seed all the remaining fields and harvest them, meaning all in one go as soon as possible. This will take several days, no idea how many but if I keep pressing hard 16-17hrs days it should be done rather soon. I'm going with the sloppy soybeans method, not caring about money anymore as I own all the land and have decent vehicles, just seed soybeans without fertilizing etc to get into harvesting as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Seasons will be set at 24 day mode just in case there is a lot of rain and it takes a while to harvest remaining fields. I don't think there will be any issue but you never know, would be ultimate waste of time to keep days number too low and have crops wither in winter.
</p>

<p>
Wanted to add john deere DB 90 planter and steiger tractor, maybe the john deere C850 air cart and 1870 air drill as well, so shut down FS19 before even got to start really playing, only time accelerated day heh. Removed vehicle speed sync mod as I have no use for it, cruise control works better. Tested those mods and C850/1870 gave error on the log and just didn't like he DB planters seed capacity of 4400 liters, just cant live with such amounts below 10k heh wow.
</p>

<p>
So I added Case IH Steiger series tractor by Steenkamp, some variation for our big bud work horses.
</p>

<pre>
- case ih steiger series with engine etc upgrades for 557.5k
- bourgault 3320-76 paralink hoe drill for 273.5k
- bourgault 71300 air cart for 331.5k
</pre>
<p>
Purchased above list, now we have new tractor and slightly smaller seeder. Its not much smaller so for those extra tight spots we still have to rely on great plains planter, but this should be nice addition to our planting season for sure.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring, time accelerated to a new year and then set it to 24 days season again so we have plenty of time seeding/harvesting all those fields.
</p>

<p>
17/late-spring in-game 0758hrs, weather +16/+10C and forecast predicts no minimum temperatures below +10C, soybeans planting season is here, lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
First field in this planting season is F79, its not really big and I will use big bud 747 with bourgault 3420-100 air drill on it, but courseplay wont work as its buggy field with trees on it. This will be manual driving with GPS. Lets hope here arent great many fields like this.

What an nightmare these first few fields have been, nothing but tree etc collisions with courseplay. Obvious when you have trees on the field, how could courseplay detect such things by reading cultivator_density, it cant.

Bought pickup truck 1978 and drove outline for F42 which had buggy courseplay operation, when clicked it was recognized as F121, no idea why. So I drove outline and generated field work course for that, sent big bud 747 on its way and drove case ih steiger with smaller bourgault air drill myself manually using GPS.

1125 Started seeding soybeans F115, courseplay ETA 2h 27min
</p>

<p>
Hmm F110 and F115 especially the latter don't look to be that large but well looking at courseplay durations, I guess they are. Big Bud 747 with bigger bourgault is doing F110 and its a bad field work course as it zig zags north/south instead of going east/west which is longer passes, every turn courseplay makes takes more time on top of the estimated duration, so that 2h 18min most likely will be like 2h 30min at least if not more.
</p>

<p>
Hmm wait a minute, writing this at 1147hrs which is just a start on those courses and now smaller bourgault already says 9min duration left, what is courseplay doing heh. I believe that 9min to be true judging by the amount of seeding left on that field.

<p>
<b>2021-01-30T0700</b> New farming day has started, this savegame now has 374hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Today we start by time accelerating several days until soybeans harvest season begins, then we start to harvest. Goal is, not probably possible today to finish this harvest season which finishes this savegame. This will be third savegame I've finished in FS19. Really looking forward to it.
</p>

<p>
While I was time accelerating got thinking about semi trucks grain trailer for hauling, last harvest season with two combines doing great soybeans I still had no problems with one truck keeping up, this harvest will be mostly poor/bad soybeans as I did not care the fields at all, I see two fields are fully fertilized just by accident (previous withered crops). So I'm going to start this harvest season with the same one truck setup, if we run into issues with longer distance fields then I can quickly purchase another semi truck and trailer and plug it into the courseplay route.
</p>

<p>
Today I'm going to live stream on twitch and youtube. Will be nice to have permanent video record of this historical final harvest on Midwest Horizons where I finish my third savegame in FS19.

<p>
<b>2021-01-31T0850</b> Back at PMC Gaming, lets finish this harvest! This savegame now has 389hrs in it.

You know the drill, less typing in local html files during live streams, more harvesting ;)

<p>
Courseplay froze up when I was generating course for F42, and I forgot to save game. So now I need to re-harvest F116 and wont be writing down those stats for a second time, so we kind of skip time until the re-harvest of F116 is done...

Night is falling quickly while I moved vehicles from one field to another, so need to skip a night. Its now 04/early-autumn in-game 1956hrs. Time accelerated until 05/early-autumn in-game 0727hrs, weather +15/+19C and forecast predicts all clear. Soil is dry as well, we are good to go.

Then it was time to call it a night, again heh. Taking a break/nap and continuing to play I don't even know what day/time it is, but sort of feel like need to get some sleep so will end stream and gaming session here. Looks like this harvest/savegame gets finished "tomorrow", so excited for that.
</p>

<p>
0651 Because of some real life issues unrelated to my doings, had to wake up only after 3 hours of sleep. So lets continue harvesting. This savegame now has 404hrs in it.

Started live streaming here, only five more fields to go and then this savegame is finished, it will happen today! I am really excited about getting my third savegame finished, five more fields to go and there is no way that anything would prevent me from finishing this in todays gaming session.

That is it, this savegame has been finished, <b>I bought all the land and harvested all the fields!</b> Whohoooo! :-)
</p>

<p>
After finishing that harvest I drove all vehicles to farm 1 (well we only had one, so yeah) and parked them nicely. This savegame wont see any game-play anymore but its just a good feeling that vehicles have been parked all nice and tidy on the farm yard.
</p>

<p>
Emotional feeling, finishing a savegame :)
</p>

<p>
When I saved and ended it there was <b>413 hours</b> of game-play in it. That is surisingly high number for 4 kilometer terrain, PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km Farm Manager mode only had like hmm 280hrs or so.
</p>

<p>
Dunno what to say, this was end of an era, my only savegame on other peoples terrain, most likely I wont be starting any other savegames like this on non PMC terrains, I just don't have time for it.
</p>

<p>
Backupped this savegame files and actual mod files into 7-zip archive for safe keeping years to come.
