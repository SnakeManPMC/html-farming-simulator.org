	<h2>Midwest Horizon Start From Zero</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-04-30</b> This was my first time playing midwest horizon which was released already few days ago. I had just attempted to take a break from PMC Iowa Garden City 8km "start from zero" career only like a day ago, but now I'm back in FS19 heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Took an harvest contract for F104, 4.8ha. It pays 7.7k minus the borrowed vehicle prices, but it was the only one available and honestly I didnt feel like doing much larger field right from the start.
</p>

<p>
0620 started harvesting F104. Did courseplay course, really not in the mood to drive manually.<br>
0741 finished harvesting F104, still need to haul grain into silo to complete the contract.<br>
0748 unloaded trailer to horizon coop, contract finished and I got money from the grain, budget now 17,587 heh my first money ;)<br>
0801 sold remaining grain from the harvest for 4,200 then collected contract reward, 6,854 and budget now 28,642.<br>
0803 accepted fertilizing contract F48, 5.3ha. With borrowed vehicles.<br>
0811 started fertilizing F48, contract.<br>
0822 finished fertilizing F48<br>
0824 collected contract reward, 9,469 and budget now 32,352.<br>
0826 leased bredal k165 with extension and spreading discs for initial cost 3,876 and 1,596 per hour fee.<br>
0827 leased new holland t6 with narrow tires for initial cost 5,253 and 2,163 per hour fee.<br>
0829 accepted all fertilizing contracts there was.<br>
0836 started fertilizing F21, contract.<br>
0845 finished fertilizing F21, collected contract reward 11,071.<br>
0847 started fertilizing F90, contract.<br>
0852 finished fertilizing F90, collected contract reward 7,280.<br>
0854 started fertilizing F88, contract.<br>
0920 finished fertilizing F88, collected contract reward 7,331. Took a while as I helped Roozsta to test john deere 220 disc :)<br>
0925 started fertilizing F10, contract.<br>
0943 finished fertilizing F10, collected contract reward 21,848.<br>
0953 started fertilizing F53, contract.<br>
1012 finished fertilizing F53, collected contract reward 16,082.<br>
1015 started fertilizing F123, contract.<br>
1023 finished fertilizing F123, collected contract reward 9,460.<br>
1031 started fertilizing F118, contract.<br>
1100 finished fertilizing F118, collected contract reward 29,595.<br>
1108 returned leased fertilizing vehicles. Budget now 89,573 which is pretty nice but nowhere near where I could start to buy my own vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Finished this first test in Midwest Horizons, the few locations I saw looked nice. In this start from zero career made a bit money but nowhere near to start thinking about buying own vehicles, it was literally a first stab at it. More tomorrow, I think.
</p>

<p>
1827 Back at PMC Gaming, firing up FS19, time for some Midwest Horizons.
</p>

<p>
It was in-game time 1245hrs and only one very small reward fertilizing contract, so time to time accelerate and see what new contracts I get next. So time accelerated a bit then came night and fastnight mod took over and fast forwarded to 0700hrs the next morning. Still no fertilizer contracts, one appeared of 27k reward but its borderline not worth it as if I lease vehicle and do only this one contract it progresses me very little in this career, I need at least 5+ contracts stacked in order to make a real progress.
</p>

<p>
1856 Had a lunch break while game was running real time, no new contracts, well any that would pay me anything, those harvest and cultivating contracts are just waste of time when I dont have proper vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated in 2hrs increments until the next evening begun at in-game 1930hrs, I let fast night do its thing and then we were in 0700hrs in the morning. Contracts did not change much over night, few more cultivating ones got added, ugh. Then tried to even restart the game just to check if it would refresh the contracts somehow (like the leftover contracts on the list which disappear upon accept), but no dice, guess the contracts are saved in missions.xml file and no restart will change that.
</p>

<p>
More time acceleration and the next night was reached, fastnight did its thing. In-game morning still no fertilizer contracts, sigh, how long will this take heh. Time accelerated to in-game 1200hrs and still nothing.
</p>

<p>
2007 Had some IRC stuff in between here. Now lets continue farming. Time accelerated in-game 1606hrs and it started raining, still no fertilizing contracts, uuh.
</p>

<p>
I'm now again paranoid thinking that could the x600 time acceleration mess up the field stage changes somehow that they are skipped. I mean it shouldn't because I only hop forward in 2hrs increments, but yeah dunno. I know that if you used the crazy x9000 or whatever the one crazy fast forward mod did it caused the crop growth to halt / skip completely during the time acceleration.
</p>

<p>
2014 Time accelerated past in-game midnight again, next day is here, still no fertilizing contracts. There was some new seeding ones so contracts do seem to update with x600 time scale.<br>
2029 Time accelerated past in-game midnight, again for the how many times is this now and still no fertilizing contracts... man, the x600 must be skipping crop growth stages as its just not possible to have any fert contracts over like what three days period, that just doesnt happen. OK, I'm going back to x120 time scale.
</p>

<p>
After switching to x120 time scale I got first spraying contract in no time, so yeah must be that x600 being too fast for FS19 engine to handle regarding crop growth stage switching.
</p>

<p>
2034 In-game time 0820hrs first fertilizing contract appeared, finally! Yes x600 definitely is too fast for FS19 engine, I'll stop using it now, I've already known that you should not use such speeds unless just skipping through the night, not even then if you can avoid it.<br>
2036 Accepted two fertilizing contracts for F04 and F12. Leased another bredal k165 solid fertilizer spreader and tractor.<br>
2042 started fertilizing F04, contract.<br>
2106 finished fertilizing F04, collected contract reward 34,242.<br>
2108 started fertilizing F12, contract.<br>
2117 finished fertilizing F12, collected contract reward 15,898.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 125.9k and no fertilizing contracts in the menu, so I'm going to return the leased vehicles that they wont burn away all my money.
</p>

<p>
2128 After x120 time accelerating to in-game 1705hrs new fertilizing contract appeared, it was 30k so quite nice but I'd still want at least one more before I bother to lease vehicles again. Its not cheap leasing and still dont have enough to by my first own tractor + spreader.
</p>

<p>
Soon after got another fertilizing contract but it was lousy 2k reward so not worth my time. Then night time in-game arrived and I let fastnight do its thing on x300 time acceleration that hopefully is not too fast for FS19 engine. At in-game 0700hrs there was two new contracts but ironically overnight the 30k one had disappeared and the new ones didnt even sum up to that heh, oh well.
</p>

<p>
I must say in this career there has been a lot of time acceleration going on.
</p>

<p>
2142 In-game 1633hrs got fertilizing contract for 30k, now I'm going to take it so I dont miss out once again. And when I ALT-TABbed back to game there was massive 127k reward one appeared as well, wow nice over one hundred and fifty grand worth of contracts, ayeah lets get to work :)<br>
2144 Leased another bredal k165 solid fertilizer spreader and tractor.<br>
2152 started fertilizing F64, contract.<br>
2212 finished fertilizing F64, collected contract reward 30,766.<br>
2224 started fertilizing F108, contract. Courseplay duration 1h 17min, heh.<br>
2344 finished fertilizing F108, collected contract reward 127,677. At the same time F64 fertilizing contract came available, again, odd? I'll take the 30k :)<br>
2350 started fertilizing F64, contract.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-01T0012</b> finished fertilizing F64, collected contract reward 30,766.
</p>

<p>
May 2019 started, whee ;)
</p>

<p>
When doing these last two fields I was already planning on how to start my farm, checked out the cheapest and most suitable land lots near the vehicle shop and crop sale point in SE corner. Vehicles are the problematic part as they cost so much when you count all of them and there is really no cheapo option to get in the start, I mean I'm done with the cheapest vehicles like 2m plows/seeders and 4m harvester headers, no thank you I want some capability on my vehicles. Yes yes I know this is what start from zero is all about, but I am not going to spend another six (6) hours harvesting with some piece of junk combine, been there done that and wasted the time that I'm never going to get back heh.
</p>

<p>
0021 Drove to vehicle shop, unloaded bredal and then returned the leased vehicles. Budget now 278.4k<br>
0044 Took one fertilizing contract, then in-game night time came, fastforward to 0700hrs and luckily the field was still not fertilized and I had the contract.
</p>

<pre>
- bredal k165 with extension and spreading discs 76k
- new holland t6 with engine upgrade 127k
===
203k
</pre>

<p>
0045 Purchased the above setup so I'm ready for some fertilizing contracts.<br>
0052 started fertilizing F83, contract. First time with my own vehicle ;)<br>
0106 finished fertilizing F83, collected contract reward 21,703. Budget now 81.8k<br>
0126 After some time acceleration one lousy fertilizing contract came along.<br>
0129 started fertilizing F88, contract.<br>
0136 finished fertilizing F88, collected contract reward 7,956. "whohoo.."<br>
0145 Got new fertilizing contract.<br>
0147 started fertilizing F30, contract.<br>
0214 finished fertilizing F30, collected contract reward 26,492.<br>
0217 After in-game midnight there was forecasted rain coming. Two new fertilizing contracts, not paying too much but I'll take them.<br>
0220 started fertilizing F43, contract.<br>
0225 finished fertilizing F43, collected contract reward 4,557.<br>

0434 started fertilizing F94, contract.<br>
0449 finished fertilizing F94, collected contract reward 22,548.<br>
0501 started fertilizing F75, contract.<br>
0521 finished fertilizing F75, collected contract reward 24,823.<br>
0535 started fertilizing F62, contract. Had to record field_edge course to this one as the field itself is not working in courseplay.<br>
0640 finished fertilizing F62, collected contract reward 81,318. Budget now 359k<br>
0643 started fertilizing F72, contract.<br>
0657 finished fertilizing F72, collected contract reward 13,872.<br>
0706 started fertilizing F21, contract.<br>
0715 finished fertilizing F21, collected contract reward 11,071.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 353.2k that is pretty nice amount of money, but unfortunately still not enough for even the most medicore starter vehicles where you dont have to suffer from the utterly useless vehicle performances anymore. I recall from my other start from zero career that it was more like well over half a million what you need to spend.
</p>

<p>
Dunno if leasing the good equipment for quick cultivating/seeding and then harvesting would be reasonable to get farm jump started.
</p>

<p>
0738 started fertilizing F81, contract.<br>
0810 finished fertilizing F81, collected contract reward 55,339.<br>
0832 Called it a night, was somewhat tired and again the game-play progress was in a kind of stalled state.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-06T0420</b> Long story short I deleted all my real world data terrains and was really disappointed / frustrated, I wanted to relax so thought about playing some FS19 and my only option with my terrains now being deleted is Midwest Horizons. So, lets continue.
</p>

<p>
Decided to get this career rolling and buying my first own field and minimum vehicles. I even considered taking out a loan which goes against the very core of what start from zero is about, but luckily at last minute decided against it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Fast forwarded through the night (x120 scale), then restarted FS19 to upgrade into new build of courseplay.
</p>

<p>
0753 Started harvesting canola F80. Courseplay duration 1h 24min, damn that 5m header heh.<br>
0901 Sold canola in cooper farms grain for ?k<br>

1336 Finished fertilizing F41, contract, collected contract reward 47.2k.
</p>

<p>
1337 Shut down FS19, pretty tired and wasn't into playing for today anymore.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-07T0027</b> Back at PMC Gaming, farming continues. Started fertilizing F28, contract.<br>
0029 Finished fertilizing F28, contract, collected contract reward 3.2k.<br>
0033 Started fertilizing F16, contract.<br>
0038 Finished fertilizing F16, contract, collected contract reward 6.2k.<br>
0039 Started fertilizing F12, contract.<br>
0048 Finished fertilizing F12, contract, collected contract reward 15.8k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 267.3k quite nice boost by doing these few fertilizing contracts. Now I could buy more land but first things first, F80 needs weed spraying so I'm going to buy my own cheapo spraying system.
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer tank kuhn pf 1500 1.5k liter 8k
- sprayer 12m kuhn deltis 1302 mta3 1.3k liter 30k
===
38k
</pre>

<p>
0054 Purchased the above sprayer setup.<br>
0057 Started spraying F80<br>
0115 Finished spraying F80<br>
0123 Canola was growing in F80 and all I could do is wait for harvest time, so time acceleration until we get there (or have more fertilizing contracts).<br>
</p>

<p>
BTW I installed gimp v2.10.10 back to PMC Gaming computer even though I want to keep PMC DevSurf editing separate from my gaming activities. Did this because running those long courseplay tasks is ideal time to ALT-TAB into gimp and edit some terrain files, like tonight I'm editing PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km cultivator_density image.
</p>

<p>
Also I need to take screenshots for this website of all my terrains FS19 in-game mapview screens for field numbers and states, plus some generic 3D landscape shots too, I cant do this as Gaming computer has no tool to even capture stuff (no I wont be using FS19 in-game screenshot key feature).
</p>

<p>
0213 In-game 1430hrs it started to rain. Looking at the field state the rain probably will be over by the time crop is ready for harvest.<br>
0230 In-game 2030hrs my canola was ready to harvest but it was still raining.<br>
0234 In-game 0327hrs rain stopped, lets harvest this canola shall we.<br>
0235 Started harvesting canola F80<br>
0246 As soon as I start harvesting two fertilizer contracts appear, how typical.<br>
0345 Grain trailer was full but price of canola is very poor 1730 and I have no farm silo to store my stuff.<br>
0347 Purchased small farm silo 100k liter placeable for 110k
</p>

<p>
Now that I got the first farm silo, I'm hoping this wont turn into endless wait for canola market price to increase, like what happened in my start from scratch FS17 cornbelt career where I waited literally days in real time for prices to increase heh.
</p>

<p>
0427 Finished harvesting canola F80<br>
0437 Started fertilizing F80<br>
0445 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
0447 Started seeding soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
Decided to seed soybeans so I wont run out of space in the tiny farm silo right away, especially if I have to do yet another harvest after this one.
</p>

<p>
0535 Finished seeding soybeans F80<br>
0536 Started fertilizing F80<br>
0544 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
0546 Took a small break to test out Hankinson, North Dakota 4km terrain.
</p>

<p>
1002 Well that break turned out to be a bit longer, joined someone else to play MP for few hours :)<br>
1003 Fired FS19 back up, lets continue farming, well err, in my own savegame in singleplayer heh.<br>
1008 Started fertilizing F02, contract.<br>
1014 Finished fertilizing F02, contract, collected contract reward 9.5k.<br>
1018 Started fertilizing F06, contract.<br>
1030 Finished fertilizing F06, contract, collected contract reward 17.5k.<br>
1034 Started fertilizing F07, contract.<br>
1048 Finished fertilizing F07, contract, collected contract reward 18.2k.<br>
1050 Started fertilizing F05, contract.<br>
1052 Finished fertilizing F05, contract, collected contract reward 5.2k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 160.7k so I could have bought one of the close by fields, but decided to do this harvest and then make new purchases. Hopefully by that time I already have some fertilizing contracts done as well.
</p>

<p>
1059 Started spraying F80<br>
1114 Finished spraying F80<br>
1140 Time accelerated until in-game 0540hrs when two things happened simultaneously; it started to rain and my soybean crop got ready to harvest haha<br>
1156 In-game time 1005hrs I noticed that market price for canola was 2458! whoa, lets go sell! heh<br>
1159 Sold canola in horizion coop for 76.1k<br>
1202 Sold canola in horizion coop for 73.1k<br>
1209 In-game 1724hrs it stopped raining, lets harvest some soybeans, yeah! Started harvesting soybeans F80. Courseplay duration 1h 25min.<br>
1340 Finished harvesting soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
This soybean harvest got me 47,721 liters where canola brought in 60k liters. Much nicer yield in canola and its at good day almost at same sale price so yeah definitely keep seeding canola for now. Soybean market price was 2361 in cooper farms grain, so I sent tractor grain trailer there to sell using courseplay.
</p>

<p>
1350 Sold soybeans in cooper farms grain for 73.1k<br>
1405 Sold soybeans in cooper farms grain for 39.4k<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 410.3k which is pretty nice amount indeed. The combine of mine is pretty bad with 5m header, the next step up woulb be John Deere T560 with 7.6m header but I think overall I need more fields as my fertilizing, spraying and even seeding capability is mostly fine.
</p>

<p>
1412 Started fertilizing F80<br>
1420 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
1424 Started seeding canola F80<br>
1513 Finished seeding canola F80<br>
1514 Started fertilizing F80<br>
1523 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
1532 Was dead tired so time to shut down FS19 and get some shut eye, hopefully get to have busy day tomorrow editing, playing MP and then continuing this Start From Zero career as well.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-08T0449</b> Back at PMC Gaming, FS19 fired up, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
Canola is growing, its in-game 2345hrs so lets time accelerate until something happens.

1004 Finished fertilizing F66, contract, collected contract reward 22.3k.<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 474.1k nice. I think its land purchasing time. Decided to purchase land lot which has F04 but right now its cultivated state so I'm going to play the market game and wait until its seeded, just hopefully its some good crop and not crap like potatoes or something which I wont touch. So time acceleration and waiting, in-game time now 1616hrs. Well in-game 1834hrs it got seeded, you guessed it, cotton. Sigh heh.
</p>

<p>
1041 Purchased land lot which has F04 for 358.4k<br>

<p>
Harvester upgrade is here. Hopefully with this 7.6m header we can manage to start make money more easier that F80 harvesting dont take 1h 25min anymore, also the new F04 is quite large which definitely take some time to knock out. Looking forward to this next harvest with my new combine.
</p>

<p>
1427 Started harvesting canola F80. Courseplay duration 56min, okay so shaved off just about half an hour of the harvest time, guess its okay start.<br>
1532 Finished harvesting canola F80.<br>
</p>

<p>
On this harvest got total of 61,498 liters canola out of F80.
</p>

<p>
1536 Started harvesting canola F04. Courseplay duration after headland and first row done 2h 15min (yeah forgot to check at start).<br>
1639 Sold canola in horizon coop for 61k, farm small silo was full so had to sell, I'm glad the price was pretty decent at least.<br>
1716 Sold canola in horizon coop for 62.1k<br>
1735 Had been up 16hrs and most of it playing FS19 so it was time to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-05-11T1208</b> Time to fire up midwest horizon and continue start from zero career :)
</p>

<p>
I decided that from tomorrow on I'll continue editing full time and leave playing as secondary only when I get so tired of editing for the current day that I want to relax a bit by playing. Basically what I want to do is to edit like one week straight 16hrs day full intensity (more details from <a href="pmc-terrains.php">PMC Terrains</a> page) and stop wasting time by playing.
</p>

<p>
This means that midwest horizon start from zero story will be on hold for unknown amount of time. My plan is to edit my own terrain to playable level, not sure which one it will be most likely PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km which in big picture was my first terrain (its complicated). I want to start career in my own terrain which will continue until end of times. Its always better feeling to play on your own terrain. Also in the early parts of development you are doing game-play testing.
</p>

<p>
So todays midwest horizon start from zero will be my last for now, but I will play until my eyes wont stay open anymore. Interesting to see how much progress I can make, not much in the big picture but still hopefully can buy new land or maybe upgrade my vehicle fleet a bit. We'll see.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Between 1400hrs and 1429hrs I had some chow, the last time I checked canola price was 2033 and increasing, after done eating at 1429hrs the price had plummeted to mere 1745... oh wow, how many thousands did I lose during chow... man that sucks. FS19 really has some stupid market price stuff, I had no time acceleration and nothing going on, just waited 29min and poof market price goes to dogs. Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
1431 Sold canola in horizon coop for 51.5k, budget now 406.5k<br>

<p>
Right after finishing F05 I shut down FS19, been up over 16hrs almost all of it playing so time to call it a night even though I'm not really tired yet. Tomorrow... well if I can stick to my plan there will be no playing, just editing. We'll see how it goes. So hopefully next entry to this midwest horizon start from zero story comes after a loong while :)
</p>

	<h2>After The Break</h2>

<p>
<b>2019-10-12</b> I got this urge to play some very small scale farming with seasons in ravenport. Yes I know ravenport haha the joke of the community but I just wanted something familiar and very small, I have savegames in all the megalodon PMC terrains but I was not so committed to FS19 playing that I would start to spend 4hrs+ on average field work.
</p>

<p>
Downloaded Midwest Horizon v1.1 <a href="http://www.modhub.us/farming-simulator-2019-mods/midwest-horizon-v1-1-0-0/" target="_blank">modhub.us</a> as I was thinking that even though it is 4km so not the tiny default size, its still very nice small detailed terrain where I might get that kind of moderate tiny feeling what I was looking for in ravenport.
</p>

<p>
Basically all I want to do is very very small scale farming very relaxed just for 5-10min quick fun to drive tractor around, the exact opposite what the 16km terrain monster 500ha field work is. If I'd want to dig really deep into FS19 I would be playing in my own extremely large terrains.
</p>

<p>
I feel midwest horizon is large compared to ravenport so not what I want (I want tiny small scale quick fun), but lets think of it this way that midwest horizon is not ravenport shit and I don't have to buy all the farmlands right away or not at all.
</p>

<p>
Really difficult to explain what I mean, I made a promise to never again play in ravenport after the initial seasons test, so continuing to play there would be lame but at the same time midwest horizon size wise is right there with PMC North Dakota Greendale 4km so its not any 5-10min quick fun game-play.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
My previous savegame4 is start from zero, without seasons as it was not released back then. Txzar wrote in v1.1 release that it requires new savegame. New savegame is fine but I need to definitely port over my vehicles, farmlands and money.
</p>

<p>
I was considering just deleting the start from zero and beginning a new "farm manager" mode career because I'm not sure if I want to play more than couple of minutes, hours or days.
</p>

<p>
Savegame porting for xml works: vehicles, farmland, farms and items. When you copy over environment it will fail, makes FS19 go nuts, it just doesn't work with seasons. Or perhaps you could first port the terrain only v1.0 to v1.1 savegame, only after that adding seasons porting to it, but oh well I already deleted the original environment so thats that.
</p>

<p>
Around 0605hrs started midwest horizon v1.1 with ported start from zero savegame to seasons. It was just the second field I started to work on, F04, which already gave me half an hour ETA on courseplay... THIS is what I wanted to avoid with very small scale quick fun farming... I wanted to have quick 5-10min fun, now I'm spending frigging half an hour on single field haha, oh well, thats darn farmsim for ya buddy ;)
</p>

<p>
0635 started to catch up on youtube farming videos by watching first welkers farm video I have not seen since I took a break from FS19. Man there is going to be hours of videos to watch now, oh well with FS19 courseplay running... I got nothing better to do haha ;)
</p>

<p>
0648 started to spread lime to F04, courseplay ETA 49min heh<br>
0733 done spreading lime to F04<br>
0735 started spreading lime to F05<br>
0743 finished spreading lime to F05<br>
0750 started fertilizing F05<br>
0757 finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
I must say midwest horizon doesn't give me that small scale tiny quick fun farming feeling same as ravenport, even these F04, F05 and F80 feels too large for such quick fun. Yes I know, ravenport is not proper hardcore farmsim stuff, but hey that is what I wanted so... yeah.
</p>

<p>
0758 started seeding canola to F05<br>
0824 finished seeding canola to F05<br>
0825 started seeding canola to F04, courseplay ETA 2h 35min... uh oh, FS19 time sink strikes back, the horror... <b>the horror...</b> ;)<br>
1035 finished seeding canola to F04
</p>

<p>
1037 Decided to call it a night, too tired. Honestly not sure if I continue tomorrow, it was fun kinda now to take a break from elite exploring, but I mostly just watched welker farms videos instead of playing as courseplay did all the playing as usual hehe :)
</p>

<p>
2005 woke up, had a days first meal and now back at PMC Gaming, lets continue farming Midwest Horizons.<br>
2008 Started seeding canola F80, courseplay ETA 29min.<br>
</p>

<p>
But minute or two later PMC Gaming windows went haywire due electrical spike hardware glitch (long story), it did not recognize my mouse and was just weird, had to hard reset the computer.
</p>

<p>
2023 Alright started again, canola to F80, courseplay ETA 29min.
</p>

<p>
Again computer went haywire with mouse moving causing windows beep sounds and strange issues like that, I have never seen windows do that.
</p>

<p>
2110 Continuing seeding canola manually now, reset courseplay secondary action back to right mouse button. No idea if that was the issue.<br>
? Finished seeding canola F80<br>
2120 Started spraying herbicide to F80<br>
2135 Finished spraying herbicide to F80<br>
2137 Started spraying herbicide to F04, courseplay ETA 50min heh<br>
2227 Finished spraying herbicide to F04<br>
2228 Started spraying herbicide to F05<br>
2235 Finished spraying herbicide to F05
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring so now all fields are fertilized, limed, seeded canola and herbicide sprayed. Now we just wait for crops to grow.
</p>

<p>
Exited FS19 to configure keyboard controls a bit due the HOTAS shuffle.
</p>

<p>
2253 Started fertilizing F80<br>
2302 Finished fertilizing F80<br>
2304 Started fertilizing F04, courseplay ETA 23min
</p>

<p>
Noticed that F04 and F05 has weeds in them, umm how did that happen after I herbicide sprayed all the fields?
</p>

<p>
2326 Finished fertilizing F04<br>
2330 Started fertilizing F05<br>
2334 Finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
So NOW all the fields are fully fertilized and growing :)
</p>

<p>
Some time accelerating to get crops to grow, weeds still keep growing which I have to say is some kind of savegame porting bug, so I just have to take the weed hit for now (too lazy to weed them for second time) and this savegame should return to normal after next harvest.
</p>

<p>
01/early-summer weeds are growing, F04 is quite peppered with them. Going to wait few more days and then go spray them, I think, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer bored, lets go take care of the weeds (while watching youtube farming videos hehe)
</p>

<p>

0703 Sold canola for 45k<br>
0732 Sold canola for 44.9k
</p>

<p>
This F04 is not even that big of a field yet but man has it taken HOURS to harvest it with john deere T560 combine using 7.6m header. So much time spent playing is EXACTLY what I wanted to avoid in the first place, all I wanted was 5-10min quick fun... well this is not quick, I started to harvest this field on 0439hrs and still <b>three hours later</b> I'm going it. Oh wow is this that you call a quick fun?
</p>

<p>
0752 Sold canola for 44.5k<br>
0756 Finished harvesting canola F04<br>

0832 Sold canola for 12.2k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 619.4k quite nice.
</p>

<p>
My quick 5-10min fun has turned into couple of full days of playing (almost), so I've had my fun now, I can already see the horror that time sink game-play style approaching, I cannot get back into wasting my time playing like that, I just cant. So I'm not going to rage quit but will park the vehicles, save game and exit nicely, then backup savegame files. After that I'm done playing FS19 again, I cant waste my time, sorry.
</p>

<p>
0839 Repaired combine and header, budget now 617.5k. Time to call it a loooong night for FS19.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-15T0300</b> Back in FS19, lets continue where we left off.
</p>

<p>
Yes I know that I wrote above that going to take a long break... but FS19 v1.5.1 patch is to be released today and I just could not resist playing hehe, oh well.

<p>
Sold pronto seeder and leased amazon condor 15001 seeder, I need to get seed to the ground quicker.
</p>

<p>
0434 Started seeding soybeans F80, courseplay ETA 17min, pretty nice.<br>
0438 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0441 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0444 Sold canola for 44.4k<br>
0447 Sold canola for 10k<br>
0450 Sold joskin trailer and 100k liter grain bin silo, will have to get a larger ones. Budget now 923.1k
</p>

<p>
Biggest limitation in my farm right now was the grain bin silo, it was the giants default placeable of 100k liters which was already full of canola. I wanted to upgrade into PMC large farm bin silo which holds 10 million liters, so sold the canola and the small bin silo.
</p>

<p>
0504 Finished seeding soybeans F80<br>
0506 Started seeding soybeans F04, courseplay ETA 1h 50min uuh ;)<br>
0536 Purchased small land lot between F77 through F79 for 69.2k<br>
0538 Purchased PMC large grain bin silo (capacity 10 million liters) for 180k
</p>

<p>
This small land lot is just north from my fields, its a nice place to stamp down that large farm bin silo and I can even add few extra storage bins for it. Now I don't have to worry about silo capacity but just keep farming and storing the valuable crops for the time when market prices are the highest. With this fleet of equipment I have now, 10 million liter silo capacity lasts forever heh.
</p>

<p>
0543 Purchased strautmann aperion 3401 trailer for 65k<br>

0709 Finished fertilizing F05
</p>

<p>
Now all fields were seeded soybeans and fertilized to 66% stage, next is to wait until fields get germinated and grow first stage so get to fertilize one last time.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-summer in-game 0641hrs fields got germinated and are now growing. Also noticed one tiny spec of weeds in F04.
</p>

<p>
0724 Field growth stage changed, green small plants appeared. Okay lets fertilize some more.<br>

<p>
Now all fields are fully fertilized and growing. Time accelleration commences until possible herbicide spraying.
</p>

<p>
05/mid-autumn in-game 0834hrs (real life 0828hrs hehe) soybeans are ready to harvest with minimum of weeds, very nice!
</p>

<p>
Now I just need to decide what kind of solution I take for combine, I really do not want spend endless hours harvesting with that one john deere T560. Decided to sell the T560 and buy S790.
</p>

<p>
0832 Sold john deere T560 and header<br>
0833 Purchased john deere S790 for 390k and macdon fd75 header for 82.7k
</p>

<p>
Now I got some harvesting power heh.
</p>

<p>
0837 Started harvesting soybeans F80, courseplay ETA 32min<br>
0915 Finished harvesting soybeans F80
</p>

<p>
Got 54,001 liters of soybeans out of F80.
</p>

<p>
0917 Started harvesting soybeans F04<br>
1059 Finished harvesting soybeans F04
</p>

<p>
Uh oh that took a while, close to two hours... that is not quick fun. But I guess this is just continuing the Start From Zero now instead of 5-10min quick fun heh.
</p>

<p>
1103 Started harvesting soybeans F05<br>
1115 Finished harvesting soybeans F05
</p>

<p>
That's it, all done, all soybean crops harvested.
</p>

<p>
Soybean harvest for F04 185,695 liters and F05 26,788 liters.
</p>

<p>
1123 Saved game and exited, enough farming for tonight.
</p>

<p>
2218 Upgraded FS19 to v1.5.1 where the changelog didn't have much of interesting stuff, except the AI memory leak. No idea what that means in practice though, someone in giants forums speculated that could that fix the performance loss when AI hired workers (courseplay) is running (edit: it most certainly did not).
</p>

<p>
2259 Started FS19 v1.5.1 for the first time. Lets continue growing our farm, will be interesting to see today how we proceed.
</p>

<p>
Here is the recap; I own now F04, F05 and F80, plus the land lot where the farm bin silo is placed, got 266.4k liters of soybeans, current budget 337.3k hmm, I'm thinking should I do one more harvest with this setup or try to buy more land or upgrade equipment.
</p>

<p>
I really don't like the two hour courseplay ETA's no matter how much youtube farming videos I have to watch to catch up, its just such a waste of time to fiddle your thumbs while game-play takes hours. In two hours I could get so much elite exploring or arma3 editing or playing done that its just shameful waste of time to spend so long doing FS19 field work. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Decided to buy a seeder as previously I just leased it. Then it was time to do the remaining fieldwork for the winter so we are as ready as possible next spring for the next seeding. Or maybe I'll do fallow year dunno.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Then it was time accelerating through one year :)
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer soybean prices were sky high and they wont go higher than that according to the seasons market price history, its time to sell. Currently horizion coop pays 3779 per thousand liters, lets start hauling. Budget before starting to sell 129.6k
</p>

</p>

<p>
After selling budget 1.136 million! :)
</p>

<p>
07/late-summer soybean planting season was over and I was looking at some AI owned soybean fields to buy, F03, F06 and F78 are interesting. My combine harvester is the weak link now, perhaps even sprayer too, so getting more fields does really not help in my productivity as existing fields already take hours to combine but I bet the money I get from the new field soybeans would easily pay extra combine harvester which would be really helpful.
</p>

<p>
0226 Purchased land lot with F78 in it for 431.7k, F06 for 347.4k and F03 for 291k. Budget now 66.4k heh<br>

0816 Alright time to call it a night, was some good farming today. We'll see when I continue.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-18T0710</b> Back at Midwest Horizon, its kind of late in the day for me but lets see if we can still do some nice farming.

</p>

<p>
0846 Time to call it a night, was a really late start today so got energy only for such quick fieldwork.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-19T1530</b> Yikes back at FS19, forgot to write starting time down but I haven't done anything else than time accelerating 6000 speed so not much story to tell. Looking forward for the spring season and starting to seed new crops.<br>
1538 Season switched to 01/early-spring.<br>
1548 Started seeding canola F78, courseplay ETA 53min
</p>

<p>
Looks like courseplay v6.01.611 cant handle backing up that amazone condor 15001 seeder, it always messes it up, I noticed this already version or two ago and have a "last good version" batch file I can use. Will have to revert to that last good version again on the next game restart.
</p>

<p>
Because courseplay is such a nuisance (it actually does more harm than good) decided to switch to GPS at least it stops at the end of a row, then I can quickly turn the tractor around where courseplay would take forever and in this particular case it didn't even work with the backing up.
</p>

<p>
1637 Too tired have to call it a night, this was a really short farming set now, more tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<b>2019-10-20T0145</b> PMC Gaming booted up, back in FS19, back in farming.<br>

<p>
F01 had withered sugar beets so I just went lazily and seeded canola on top of it as condor 15001 cultivates as well. I wanted to get a plow and real cultivator to properly plow this field under with fertilization etc but don't have the money, oh well lets do it this way for now.
</p>

</p>

<p>
And that wrapped up the planting season for this spring. Not sure what I put down as double crop, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Next we are going to fertilize the fields and then comes time acceleration. At that point we start to see weeds growing so we have to decide if we go spray them. Once enough days go by then we get into soybeans selling day, it should be roughly first day of mid-summer. Then we get a lot of money from the 337k liters of soybeans, depending on the sell price. Money which is then used to purchase at least powerful tractor to pull cultivator, I'd also like to buy a second combine but we'll have to see how much money we'll make from the sales.
</p>

<p>
0504 Started fertilizing F80, courseplay ETA 8min<br>

<p>
Speaking of weeds, first medium size patch already appeared on F80 when I was fertilizing it. I have been quite lucky with weeds as so little of them have appeared, although I did blanked spray the whole fields previously if I recall correctly.

<p>
Okay all work done (well besides possible herbicide spraying), now its time to skip ahead to the soybean selling time with those good market prices :)
</p>

<p>
08/late-spring looks like F78 and F80 are getting fair amount of weeds. I'll keep monitoring them.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer is here and the best day/time to sell soybeans. Currently in-game 0611hrs soybean market price is 3725 in horizion coop. Time to start haulin' :)
</p>

<p>
Just as I started hauling soybeans for sell the current canola crops switched to harvest ready, uh oh I completely missed that in my soybean sell excitement, now my fields are somewhat weeded. Weeds are not too bad but yeah F78 northern part and F80 looked sort of nasty, oh well next time I'll keep a better handle on things, this kind of slipped away from me now heh. Anyways lets get to hauling grain...
</p>

<p>
So to recap we got 337,245 liters of soybeans and currently the market price is 3725 per thousand liters. Thats pretty nice set to sell.
</p>

<p>
0832 Sold soybeans for 193.7k<br>
0838 Sold soybeans for 193.7k<br>
0843 Sold soybeans for 193.7k<br>

0902 Ran out of soybeans in the farm bin silo, only got 25.2k liters, last haul<br>
0905 Sold soybeans for 94k
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.266 million, yeah! :)
</p>

<p>
Soybeans market price did not drop at all during selling, it remained solid 3725. Next is some vehicle purchases, I definitely need cultivator and tractor to pull it, I'm going to get my workhorse big bud 450 and john deere 2410 5 section cultivator (flexicoil would be nice but its more expensive). Also I need another combine so that these harvests get done quicker.
</p>

<pre>

- tractor to pull cultivator big bud 450 with gps and twin wheels 252k

</p>

<p>

<p>
0126 Was too tired had to go back to sleep, just one of those days... more farming after few more hours of sleep.
</p>

<p>
0523 Nap done and had a nice meal, time to get back to farming. Lets continue lime spreading...
</p>

<p>

0607 Finished lime spreading F05<br>
0608 Started lime spreading F06, courseplay ETA 29min
</p>

<p>
Was not planning on spreading lime to F06 as it didn't really require it, but it had so many patches of lime required due seasons crops failing patches that it kept annoying me, so here we go lets blanket it with lime, be done with it.
</p>

<p>
The crops failed patches created by seasons is great... but they basically cause you to cultivate after each harvest so you can clean them off. For example on withered crops lime will not stick, only fertilizer sticks through all the patches created by seasons. Its really annoying to have these patches in the field after harvest while working on the next one.
</p>

<p>
While lime spreading was running it was time to buy some vehicles.
</p>

<pre>
- auger wagon 300hp brent 1596 53k liter 118k
- trailer krampe sb II 30/1070 78k
- truck lizard hulk with paint 146k
</pre>
<p>
0630 Purchased above list for 342k
</p>

<p>
I was really struggling with the almost beginner level grain trailer, on the last harvest it was really painful to use. Now with the truck and proper auger wagon I can harvest normally, unloading the combines with auger wagon while truck is hauling a load to the farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
When time comes to sell my crops, the truck and trailer does proper job on it unlike tractor (with twin wheels that it wont fit horizion coop hehe). I wanted to buy wilson trailer but because using courseplay I cant as it would only fill one hopper, thats why I use krampe.
</p>

<p>
All done now in preparation for seeding. Two days left in soybeans planting season but was thinking of not to push it and just time accelerate to canola selling day, do some selling and then time accelerate rest of the year until spring.
</p>

<p>
But eventually decided to go for it and seed soybeans, never done that so late in the seeding season (05/mid-summer 0800hrs) so will be interesting to see if they get harvest ready before winter kills them off. They should grow ok.

Soybeans have been seeded, aayeah! I hope after the next grain sell I have enough money to buy better seeding equipment and perhaps even corn planter so that future seeding seasons go by quickly, this amazone condor 15001 is quite nice medium size seeder but once you start to stack up those hectares on big fields... yeah its not so nice anymore.

Soybean seeding is complete with full fertilization. Now its just time accelerating keeping an eye on weed growth, then when canola selling day comes we make some money.
</p>

<p>
Not sure when our soybeans will be ready, they were seeded really late so hopefully they are harvest ready before winter kills them off, it possibly could be around the time canola selling day comes. Will be interesting to see.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-summer in-game 1520hrs fields got germinated succesfully, thats odd as I recall germination happens midnight, hmm maybe the growth stage change still is only applied according to seeding time or something, dunno.
</p>

<p>
03/early-autumn in-game 0713hrs very few weeds have grown so far, five small patches in F06 rest are clean. We are now already well into soybeans harvest season but obviously ours is still very much growing, they arent even flowering yet.
</p>

<p>
Decided to go herbicide spray F06 by cherry picking only the weed patches. That was done quick, took couple of minutes.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-autumn in-game 0810hrs fields are ready to harvest! wow that happened much sooner than I expected, nice. Okay, lets start harvesting then :)
</p>

Looking forward to this harvest with truck trailer and auger wagon, will be fun to start farming like normal people :)

Using massey ferguson 7726 with 270hp to pull brent 1596 auger wagon which requires 400hp, you can <i>really</i> feel how underpowered the tractor is. It pulls it, sure... but you really appreciate something with proper horsepower like fendt 1050.

</p>

<p>
Now I have 901.8k liters of canola and 683.9k liters of soybeans. That is going to make me some serious amount of money to develop my farm heh. Next its just time accelerating until we are in the canola selling day.
</p>

<p>
Missed the highest selling day because I was waiting for the price to increase some more, looks like the specific day is when you get the highest price you just have to take what price you get, or wait for the next year for better luck. Price was indeed 2200 but dropped when I time accelerated some more. Oh well now have to sell for 2058 per thousand liters.
</p>
