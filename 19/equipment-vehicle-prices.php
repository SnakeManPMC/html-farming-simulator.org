	<h2>Equipment and Vehicle Prices</h2>

<p>
<b>2020-03-25</b>
</p>

<p>Its always a struggle to grow your farm as quickly and efficiently as possible, I often ask myself what is the best starter vehicle fleet possible. This page should list the most basic setups for bare minimum vehicles you need to run your farm, prepare the field, plant, harvest and transport the grain to a selling point.
</p>

<p>
Note that this list is vehicles only, no placeables for bin silos etc. Also this list is with in-game vehicles without any required mods (other than optional 15k GPS). Prices are listed as "k" thousands and "m" millions.
</p>

	<h2>Cheapest</h2>

<p>
Cheapest vehicles list for Start From Zero or otherwise money limited careers (I don't do from zero anymore btw, hah). Make sure you understand that these are the cheapest, smallest and slowest, the most painful vehicles you could ever buy heh.
</p>

	<h2>Medium</h2>

<p>
Medium vehicle fleet is something you would upgrade to or perhaps buy with farm-manager type game-mode, perhaps. These vehicles are smallest / cheapest possible but still enjoyable and powerful enough to get the job done within reasonable time.

Now this is where we start to have some fun and do large scale farming with biggest, most powerful and widest vehicles possible.

<p>
When you got to do big boy large scale farming you absolutely should get some mods which increase your farming capability big time.

<p>
Do yourself a favor and download mods, Platinum Edition Claas DLC has the largest combine, Bourgault DLC has the largest seeder and air cart. Then various free user made mods for plows, tractors, trucks, trailers etc you name it. With mods possibilities are endless.
