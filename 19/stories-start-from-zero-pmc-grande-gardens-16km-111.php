<b>2021-05-06T0408</b> New farming day has started. This savegame now has 1017hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
Spent few days of just editing PMC Iowa Garden City 8km placing some trees, its been slow progress but did not want to come to play FS19 on Gaming computer at all as I consider it waste of time. Today however... I just stood up and started Gaming computer so here I am, hmm okay, I guess...
</p>

<p>
