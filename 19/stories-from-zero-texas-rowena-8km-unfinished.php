	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This is a long lost story of <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=22739" target="_blank">Start From Zero</a> savegame on <a href="pmc-texas-rowena-8km.php" target="_blank">PMC Texas Rowena 8km</a> Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) real world data terrain.
</p>

<p>
2021-02-01 Note the date of june 2019 which is by now ages ago, this was before FS19 Seasons mod I believe, that might have caused for me having so many fertilizing contracts in so early on the savegame. I had forgotten this savegame until I saw the .PHP web page file in PMC Gaming HTML dir hehe, I have now finished New Farmer game-mode in PMC Texas Rowena 8km so this Start From Zero... is obsolete, right?
</p>

<p>
After finding this story text, it was added to list of stories being added online, it took all these years until now at 2024 to get this page released, better late than never I guess <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

</p>


	<h2>Second Day Fertilizing Contracts</h2>

<p>
1207 Back at PMC Gaming, lets start up FS19 and continue farming.<br>

<p>
Had to take an hour break cooking food and have a lunch.
</p>

<p>

1508 Accepted contract for fertilizing F33<br>
1514 Started fertilizing F33, contract.
</p>

<p>
PMC Texas Rowena 8km v0.1 looks pretty good with fields, farmlands, buildings and utility poles done. Still of course has that barren empty look because no trees or bushes or any other kind of small decorations. This part of Texas dont have many trees though, so there wont be drastic change on the look when vegetation is placed, I'd say the random bushes might give better upgrade to the look than trees as weird as that sounds. We'll see. In any case I'm really happy how Rowena is developed currently.
</p>

<p>
1528 Finished fertilizing F33, contract, collected contract reward 47.8k.<br>
1538 Accepted contract for fertilizing F39<br>

1555 Started fertilizing F76, contract.<br>
1643 Finished fertilizing F76, contract, collected contract reward 99.9k.<br>
1643 Accepted contract for fertilizing F72<br>
1645 Started fertilizing F72, contract.<br>
1707 Finished fertilizing F72, contract, collected contract reward 74.6k.<br>
1708 Accepted contract for fertilizing F49<br>
1710 Started fertilizing F49, contract.<br>
1729 Finished fertilizing F49, contract, collected contract reward 56.9k.<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 656.7k, quite sum heh. Time to return this leased rubicon 9000
</p>

<p>
1731 Purchased rubicon 9000 with gps for 504k. Budget now 143.1k<br>
1733 Decided to call it a night, time for some editing. The current progress is on nice pace but nothing sexy would not happen for a while again after buying that first own rubicon sprayer, it would be just more and more fertilizing contracts and for that, I'll play on another day...
</p>


	<h2>The End</h2>

<p>
2024-02-06T08:33:00Z Release of this one page story, conclusion and thoughts.
</p>

<p>
There are no further story for this savegame, it almost feels like it was forgotten during the heavy terrain development and then came the now official "finished savegame" which is New Farmer game-mode to which there are no story written, there are videos in youtube either straight up captured videos or twitch live stream video-on-demand uploads. You can find them from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pmcsince1984/search?query=%22pmc%20texas%20rowena%208km%22" target="_blank">youtube/pmcsince1984 "PMC Texas Rowena 8km" search</a>.
</p>

<p>
This page is so short it was almost not worth to release, but its part of our FS19 real world data terrain development history so decided to put it online, regardless of its size.
