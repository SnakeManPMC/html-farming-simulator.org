	<h2>2021-04-18 Seeding Corn For Five Hours Soybeans For Six Hours</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-04-18T0136</b> Back at PMC Gaming, lets farm. This savegame now has 972hrs in it.
</p>

<p>
10/mid-spring in-game 1413hrs, weather +17/+6C and canola got seeded yesterday, today we move bourgault air drills to F82 and break out great plains corn planters in preparation to plant corn on F56 when soil temperature is right.
</p>

<p>
This means getting more seeds from farm 1 bin silo with semi truck, probably needs to take fendt 1050 with elmers haulmaster to the same seed pickup. Lotsa hauling.
</p>

<p>
Picked up 70k liters of seeds from farm 1 bin silo, now seeds left 2.418m liters, still plenty to go. Drove them to bourgault air drills and filled them up and sent them into F82. Drove semi truck to pick up its second trailer, then drove it to farm 1 bin silo and again loaded it up with seeds, now full 140k load. Farm 1 bin silo has seeds left 2.307m liters.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time for a lunch break, funny as haven't got to do any field work yet heh, logistics of large terrains man, it ain't no joke...
</p>

<p>
0219 Lunch break...<br>
0301 Feeding time is over, back to logistics
</p>

<p>
Then drove semi truck with full 140k load into F82. Thinking about just taking the shortcut and refill great plains corn planters from the seed buy point at F72 SE because otherwise would have to drive slow fendt 1050 with auger wagon all the way to farm 1 and back, plus once again to go dump leftover seeds.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated to 11/mid-spring in-game 0826hrs. Refilled diesel fuel on four case optum 300 cvx tractors which pull great plains yp-2425a corn planters.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated to 14/mid-spring in-game 0836hrs. Alright lets refill great plains yp-2425a corn planters as we are slowly getting closer to corn/soybeans planting temperatures. Hmm F56 is a monster size so hmm guess I need to take BOTH fendt 1050s with elmer haulmasters, record courseplay routes to and back from farm 1 bin silo so they can go pickup seeds from there.
</p>

<p>
Used pickup truck 1978 to record courseplay route from F82 to farm 1 and back, uuh such long driving. Then sent fendt (sentfentwhat? huh) 1050s there to get some seeds, I will not buy seeds when our own farm has over two million liters to use. Elmer haulmasters pickup up full loads of seeds, bin has now 2.167m liters left.
</p>

<p>
Once back at F56 refilled great plains planters. And then we just time accelerate waiting for corn/soybeans planting temperatures.
</p>

<p>
18/late-spring in-game 0816hrs, weather +13/+10C and forecast doesn't show anything below planting temperatures, we are good to go.
</p>

<p>
0452 Started seeding corn F56, courseplay ETA 5h 10min, 4x tools<br>
0457 Started seeding soybeans F82, courseplay ETA 6h 10min, 2x tools
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-04-18T0504.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2021-04-18T0504.jpg" alt="PMC Grande Gardens 16km Terrain, Start From Zero Story" loading="lazy" class="terrainimg"></a>

<p>
Corn and soybeans planting season has begun, aayeah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well only single field per crop so not much of a "season" there but anyways. Also check out those crazy 5-6 hours seeding times, plus any refill and turning delays we get on top of that, oh my.
</p>

<p>
This is large scale farming, get on with the program or get the hell out, we got not room for wussies! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now only question is how many refills for each field, hmm I think those great plains will take... uh oh, 5 refills, at least? Bourgaults on this 636ha field... two was already on the previous smaller field so clearly three, dont think it requires fourth one, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
So just like yesterday, now I'll just chill and watch youtube farming videos etc <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

063? Both bourgaults refilled, more soybeans into the ground<br>

First elmers haulmaster ran out of seed, had to bring in the second one. After refilling was complete I sent first one back to farm 1 bin silo to grab some more seeds, we're gonna need 'em ...
</p>

<p>
0720 Elmers haulmaster picked up 70k load of seeds, bin remaining now 2.097m liters<br>
0722 Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
0727 All great plains planters refilled, off they go<br>
0801 Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
0805 All great plains planters refilled, off they go<br>
0812 Lead bourgault air cart is empty, time to refill the big boys
</p>

<p>
Semi truck trailer got empty, now need to switch into the second trailer which has dolly attached to it. Swapping the dolly off and then take second trailer was a pain, would have been much nicer to just use single trailer and send it to pickup more seeds while air drills are seeding. Using courseplay to have the semi drive that seed loop every time its seeds are less than 51k would have been just fine, well basically it would mean that one refill one pickup trip, but yeah I just don't like that dolly swapping. Maybe having two trucks with single trailers would have been even more efficient.
</p>

<p>
Now both fields look about half way seeded, we are slowly getting there. And now I'm going to grab lunch, I'm starving...
</p>

<p>
0817 Both bourgaults refilled, more soybeans into the ground<br>
0838 Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
0842 Elmers haulmaster is empty, switching to full one...<br>
0845 All great plains planters refilled<br>
0852 Send second semi truck grain trailer to farm 1 bin silo to pickup seeds (bin silo left with 2.027m liters now)<br>
0905 Oops forgot to send fendt 1050 elmers haulmaster to go pickup more seeds too, stay focused!<br>
0918 Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
? All great plains planters refilled<br>
0934 Elmers haulmaster picked up load of seeds, remaining in bin now 1.957m liters<br>
095? Lead bourgault air cart is empty, time to refill the big boys<br>
1002 Both bourgaults refilled, more soybeans into the ground<br>
? Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
? All great plains planters refilled, off they go
</p>

<p>
Heh guess I have forgotten to write down refill start/end times big time here, ouch. Watching youtube real life farming videos on the second monitor and I'm easily distracted. Hey come on now, its been already a long day planting and how many damn times I've already refilled, this is getting old so don't judge me too harshly <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
As of writing this we are getting to the last few passes on these huge fields, its not over yet but we'll get there.
</p>

<p>
1041 Lead great plains corn planter is empty, refill time!<br>
1045 All great plains planters refilled, off they go<br>
1116 Finished seeding corn F56
</p>

<p>
Refilled great plains seeds and also diesel fuel for puma optums, now they are nicely parked away and ready to go in next planting season.
</p>

<p>
1132 Finished seeding soybeans F82
</p>

<p>
Uaah all finished. Great feeling to get planting season wrapped up <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove fendt 1050 elmers haulmaster into farm 1 bin silo and overloaded remaining seeds there, then send tractor back to F82 where its harvest fleet buddies are. Also semi truck did bring remaining 21k liters of seeds back to farm 1 bin silo, our planting season is now officially over.
</p>

<p>
After semi truck dumped seeds to bin silo, its seed amount is now 2.032m liters.
</p>

<p>
1158 Shut down FS19 for short break...
</p>

<p>
But that wasn't a break as I had to call it a day, just had no mental energy left to put any effort for farming game-play. We'll get to harvest season next time.
