	<h2>2020-10-30 Courseplay Harvester Startup Freeze</h2>

<p>
<b>2020-10-30T1245</b> Back at PMC Gaming and FS19 fired up, this savegame has now 741 hrs.
</p>

<p>
Not super motivated to harvest today, but thought of doing one small section of F30 soybeans harvest, at least we are that much closer to finishing this historical monster field.
</p>

<p>
1307 Had grain truck and combine courseplay courses generated, then engaged first combine with "first waypoint" start option... and again courseplay froze FS19 that I had to taskmanager kill the game process, sigh.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay some recent versions started to do this with multiple tools, not sure what goes wrong in there it depends how the course has been generated but I haven't been able to figure out the pattern/cause of it to be able to avoid such courses. Oh well just need to generate new different starting point course and hope for the best.
</p>

<p>
1622 Finished harvesting soybeans F30 central east.<br>
1636 Decided to call it a day, was nice time so don't want to burn myself out continuing more today.
