2013 FS19 froze twice while refilling liquid fertilizer to rubicon 9000. My patience is running <i>real</i> thin here...
</p>

<p>
2015 Started fertilizing F34, courseplay ETA 19min, 2x tools<br>
2038 Finished fertilizing F34
</p>

<p>
It was lunch time but I was so bored or... lack of farming enthusiasm that while going to eat I decided to leave F33 cultivating running alone. I almost always eat while playing but now I'm planning on watching some tv or something, otherwise I would just shut down PMC Gaming and probably not play anymore today. Hey at least I get the cultivating done today.

<p>
2321 Its time to call it a night, even with lunch and tv breaks I cant keep enthusiasm up it has just become a chore... we'll continue when we get the enthusiasm back...
