	<h2>Iowa, Garden City, From Zero</h2>

<p>
Please read the background idea for <a href="stories.php">our farm sim stories</a> so you understand what is this all about.
</p>

<p>
What you are reading is Unofficial Start From Zero, you can check out the original <a href="stories-from-zero-garden-city-iowa.php">Start From Zero PMC Iowa Garden City 8km (pre re-design version)</a> to see what happened in 2019.
</p>

<p>
When I initially started this savegame and writing story text for it that was called <i>Cultivator contracts Iowa Garden City</i>. My goal was NOT to start proper Start From Zero career savegame on <a href="pmc-iowa-garden-city-8km.php">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km</a> v0.1 terrain, it was just something to goof around passing time. Little did I know that this evolved to thing of its own, at current time of writing this opening text its hmm fourth day I believe that I'm playing it and no end in sight, ooh my! hehe. Okay just wanted to let you know about some background, read on <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Important note: this career savegame was played completely through BEFORE <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=187736" target="_blank">Better Contracts mod</a> was released. Signifigance of this is that better contracts mod is pretty much game changer regarding Start From Zero savegames, of how easy it is to get started.

</p>

<p>
Lunch break time.
</p>

<p>
1159 Feeding time is over, back to doing contracts

</p>

<p>
Got 934 as reward, yes nine hundred and thirty four... that is not much, why spend this cultivating time for such money heh. I need to setup hard limit of lets say... 5k for cultivating contracts with borrowed vehicles because it really is no point drive all the way up to the field and then get few hundreds as reward.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1251.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1251.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
1418 Finished cultivating F226, contract, collected contract reward 12.9k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 44.1k which is pretty much enough to lease rubicon and buy some fertilizer pallets. No more contracts which offered borrowed vehicles, refreshed and new contracts shows up with few seeding ones as well, but yeah I want fertilizing contracts so I'm going to time accelerate 600 speed just to be sure there is not any sync issues.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-spring in-game 0754hrs, still no fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-spring in-game 0705hrs, still no new contracts, seems to be just those old cultivating and couple of seeding ones. Lets continue time accelerating to see when they change.
</p>

<p>
07/late-spring in-game 0719hrs, few cultivating and seeding contracts appeared. Seeding ones pay somewhat okay-ish, but I bet it takes a while to seed 15ha+ field and dunno how much seed it takes. I have no up to date data about how lucrative seeding contracts are.
</p>

<p>
09/late-spring and still no fertilizing contracts, hopefully they now start to appear after planting season for basic crops is over (soybeans and corn is still going on several days).
</p>

<p>
02/early-summer in-game 1514hrs, first fertilizing contracts appeared, yeehaaw! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1508 Accepted contract for fertilizing F64 and accepted contract for fertilizing F107<br>
</p>

<pre>
- john deere 6155m with gps
- spreader bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit
</pre>
<p>
1510 Leased above setup for 3.8k and 7.2k initial costs
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10 fertilizer pallets.
</p>

<p>
1521 Started fertilizing F64, contract. manually with GPS and finished fertilizing F64, contract, collected contract reward 968.<br>
1530 Started fertilizing F107, contract. Manually
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1531.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1531.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
1550 Finished fertilizing F107, contract, collected contract reward 37.9k.<br>
</p>

<p>
Drove to vehicle shop, unloaded fertilizer from spreader and then returned leased equipment. Budget now 52.5k.
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate waiting for more fertilizing contracts, could not risk keeping the vehicle because it just bleeds the rent lease whatever cost.
</p>

<p>
03/early-summer in-game 0620hrs, no new contracts. In-game 1513hrs two lucrative new fertilizing contracts appeared.
</p>

<p>
1601 Accepted contract for fertilizing F208 and accepted contract for fertilizing F75
</p>

<p>
Leased 6155m and brdal k165 with spreader discs, almost same as before. Purchased 4 fertilizer pallets.
</p>

<p>
1609 Started fertilizing F75, contract. manually with GPS
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T161035.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T161035.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
1626 Finished fertilizing F75, contract, collected contract reward 31.4k.
</p>

<p>
On my way to the next field I stopped by vehicle shop and purchased two more pallets of fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
1637 Started fertilizing F208, contract. manually with GPS
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1650.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-18T1650.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
1726 Finished fertilizing F208, contract, collected contract reward 93.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 149.6k not bad for half a days work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove to vehicle shop, unloaded fertilizer and then returned leased vehicles. It was now 03/early-summer in-game 1644hrs.
</p>

<p>
1731 Time to call it a night, most likely this whole savegame as ended, dunno heh.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-02-19T0727</b> Back at PMC Gaming and guess we are continuing doing contracts, as I simply felt like it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Day will start by time accelerating while waiting for fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
04/mid-summer in-game 0631hrs, one fertilizing contract appeared, 44k reward its okay, I'd like to have another one at least but guess its time to lease another tractor and bredal so we can get to work.
</p>

<p>
0734 Accepted contract for fertilizing F201<br>
0739 Started fertilizing F201, manually with GPS
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T074002.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T074002.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
Was making a plan to buy my first small tractor and fertilizer spreader, bredal K105 would be really cheap and 14k liters capacity, not sure about tractor I guess that frequently leased john deere 6155M works okay, but might try to find similar horsepower one cheaper if possible.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T074022.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T074022.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T0743.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T0743.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
0803 Finished fertilizing F201, contract, collected contract reward 44.7k.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T0803.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T0803.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
Budget now 183k. Drove tractor to vehicle shop and returned it.
</p>

<p>
John deere 6155M with the options I've been running would cost 147.5k and bredal k105 would cost 47.7k so I dont have enough money yet, would have to do one more fertilizing contract to get that money together. So lets time accelerate again.
</p>

<p>
05/mid-summer in-game 0704hrs, one new fertilizing contract just enough for me to then be able to buy those above vehicles. However before we start that its lunch time, I'm starving <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
0818 Lunch break ...<br>
0838 Feeding time is over, back to contracts<br>
0839 Accepted contract for fertilizing F15
</p>

<p>
Leased bredal k105 with spreader disc and usual john deere 6155M with GPS.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have fertilizing contracts running nicely I'm still tempted to start doing those cultivating contracts using courseplay, to just take as many as I can and send courseplay tractors off one by one. It would take a long time, facts on cultivating contracts do not change just by taking many of them, individual contracts can still take hours.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing contracts are much shorter duration and pay so much more, that's why I like them. Taking massive amounts of cultivating contracts of course would sum up to good money in the end, but yeah hours for 10-15k rewards on average doesnt sound very appealing.
</p>

<p>
0851 Started fertilizing F15, manually with GPS<br>
0905 Finished fertilizing F15, contract, collected contract reward 27k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 200.3k oh nice! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove tractor back to vehicle shop, unloaded fertilizer and returned leased equipment. Then no more fertilizing contracts even with refreshing them so time acceleration it is.
</p>

<p>
0919 Accepted contract for fertilizing F73
</p>

<p>
This contract was on after midnight so I took it and continued to time accelerate until morning daylight.
</p>

<pre>
- john deere 6155m with gps for 147.5k
- spreader bredal k105 with extension and 6m spreading unit for 47.7k
</pre>
<p>
0923 Purchased above setup and two bags of fertilizer. Budget now 1.2k hehe
</p>

<p>
Now we have our own very first tractor and implement. Now there is no need for lease anything, we can just use our own equipment. Now the money starts to come in.
</p>

<p>
0930 Started fertilizing F73, contract. manually with GPS<br>
1013 Finished fertilizing F73, contract, collected contract reward 58.5k.<br>
</p>

<p>
Budget now 59.7k, pretty nice start after purchasing our first tractor.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
1021 Accepted contract for fertilizing F197, F216 and F113<br>
1029 Started fertilizing F197, contract. manually with GPS

<p>
1040 Finished fertilizing F197, contract, collected contract reward 20.8k.<br>
1047 Started fertilizing F216, contract. manually with GPS<br>
1052 Finished fertilizing F216, contract, collected contract reward 8.7k.<br>
1058 Started fertilizing F113, contract. manually with GPS<br>
1128 Finished fertilizing F113, contract, collected contract reward 57.1k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 146.6k oh man do I love these fertilizing contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to try how those seeding contracts flow, like does it take too long to complete them and how much seed refills do you need to do.
</p>

<pre>
- pronto 9 dc with fertilization inactive 5.3k initial cost
- case puma 240 with gps 11.6k initial cost
</pre>
<p>
1155 Leased above setup
</p>

<p>
Then purchased four 2.k liter seed pallets.
</p>

<p>
1159 Accepted contract for seeding F252, F226, F17, F172, F251 and F175<br>
1204 Started seeding barley F172, contract. manually with GPS
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T1207.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T1207.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T1208.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Iowa-Garden-City-8km-2021-02-19T1208.jpg" alt="PMC Iowa Garden City 8km terrain, Start From Zero savegame" loading="lazy" style="padding: 3px 15px;width:auto;height:auto;"></a>

<p>
1242 Ran out of seeds, going to refill<br>
1245 Purchased two 2.1k liter pallets of seeds
</p>

<p>
This was 19ha field and when seeding was 65% I already felt somewhat exhausted, I'm thinking this might have been a mistake to take these seeding contracts. Rewards are great for sure, F17 is one hundred thousand but its also pretty large field. Doing it with this horsch pronto 9 dc seeder, yeah that is going to take a long while.
</p>

<p>
I did do seeding contracts in 2019 but honestly I have no recollection if they were good or bad, at least one corn planting contract was bad as it required several refills and yeah took what felt like forever.
</p>

<p>
Dunno maybe I should have leased more powerful equipment, but I thought this pronto with its 5k liter capacity and 18km/h speed is enough, looks like it ain't as its only 9m width. Dunno, maybe I'll do quick reshuffle and lease seed hawk and start to rock'n'roll a bit. We'll see after this field is done.
</p>

<p>
Checked out what lease cost would it be for seed hawk and big bud 747 would be required to pull it which is of course quite cheap when it comes to high powered tractors. Not sure if any other smaller seeder would help me out but still be reasonable cheap to lease. I don't have much experience in those medium sized equipments, either I use starter junk or biggest stuff <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
Purchased 16 2.1k liter seed pallets.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Its clear now that this seeding experiement was a bit mistake, its taken forever and while those payouts are nice... so are the lease and seed costs as well. Will be really interesting to see if I come on top of this and if so how much.
</p>

<p>
All I can think of right now is how many fertilizing contracts and "progress" could have I made if I just stuck with time accelerating and fertilizing contracts instead. I bet it would be already next year.
</p>

<p>
Once this field is done I'll cash in the reward and then I have to skip night... but dunno how many thousands that will bleed us on lease money, but I don't see any other alternative as I cant see anything and its very strange terrain to me heh.

<p>
07/late-summer in-game 2119hrs, one ~3k fertilizing contract appeared. Budget now 207.6k. Then it was skipping the night.
</p>

<p>
At midnight lost -27.7k lease costs which was in reality only like 9k or so, budget now 198.6k.
</p>

<p>
08/late-summer in-game 0630hrs, rise and shine, we have some seeding contracts to do. Lets go.

<p>
1654 Finished seeding F251, contract, collected contract reward 44.8k.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I accepted reward for F251 a fertilizing contract appeared, nice. But we will focus first on these seeding contracts, I have my doubts I manage to finish them today before I'm dead tired.
</p>

<p>
1656 Started seeding wheat F252, contract. manually with GPS

</p>

<p>
Drove big bud 747 and seed hawk into vehicle shop, refilled from the last partial seed pallet... and then unfortunately it was time to call it a night even though I really wanted to continue, but there is no point as there is probably few hours more of contracts to do, the sooner I get to bed the sooner I can wake up tomorrow and continue.
</p>

<p>
1721 Time to call it a night, shut down FS19
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-02-20T0135</b> New farming day has started.

<p>
Purchased 12 2.1k liter pallets of seed, refilled seed hawk air cart, then was good to go for last seeding contracts.

0217 Started seeding barley F104, contract. manually with GPS
</p>

<p>
Hmm at least one maybe two fertilizing contracts appeared when finishing these two fields. Two seeding contracts as well but dunno if I want to continue taking them as it just takes so long to drive slow big bud 747 to the fields and finish big field work, fertilizing with bredal spreader is so much quicker.
</p>

<p>
0239 Finished seeding barley F104, contract, collected contract reward 31.9k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 296.4k getting close to three hundred grand. Decided to take at least one more seeding contract because it was quite close to my seeders current location.

More seeding contracts appeared while I completed mine, but here is where I draw the line, no more seeding, we go back to fertilizing.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 360.3k which is quite respectable neighborhood, you could buy a big tractor and cheap implement with that money or perhaps two small tractors with spreaders for some more fertilizing capacity.
</p>

<p>
Drove big bud 747 and seed hawk to vehicle shop, unloaded remaining seeds and returned the leased equipment.

<p>
Budget now 398.8k. It was 08/late-summer in-game 1144hrs and no more fertilizing contracts, couple of seeding ones but I don't want to go back doing those and cultivating ... nah, we are way passed that kind of crap contracts heh. Time accelerating until more fertilizing contracts appear.
</p>

<p>
09/late-summer in-game 0656hrs, no new contracts. In-game 2105hrs night had fallen and one fertilizing contracts appeared, I'm going to accept it now but still skip the night.

</p>

<p>
Budget now 417.8k slowly creeping towards half a million when I could buy rubicon 9000 heh.
</p>

<p>
02/early-autumn in-game 0723hrs two cultivating contracts appeared. Dunno I'm kind of feeling bummed out to miss out on all these cultivating ones, but they are just so painful to do with borrowed vehicles as they pay like nothing. If I used my own two or more vehicles and courseplay, that would be different but I don't have such expensive cultivating horsepower tractors.
</p>

<p>
Another option is just mass spam cultivating contracts using courseplay and let the lag fest begin when 10+ vehicles are running at the same time. This would not fit to the original Start From Zero design which is no courseplay or GPS before you have your own vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Dunno, more time accelerating and hoping for good fertilizing contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
03/early-autumn in-game 1509hrs, one new cultivating contract. 04/mid-autumn in-game 0814hrs, one low paying fertilizing contracts, well gotta take it and two cultivating contracts.
</p>

<p>
Now those cultivating contracts just start to annoy me, I kind of want to buy "high speed tiller" cultivator which would cover ground faster and get a high horsepower tractor to pull it and then attack all those numerous but low paying cultivating contracts. Dunno what would come out of it, at least it would make me spend more time here, but it might be wasted time for the money hehe. I would need like 6 cultivators running constantly under courseplay to get anykind of good money out of those contracts, ie more contracts done.
</p>

<p>
This contract I'm taking pays so little its almost not worth the drive over to the field and product cost, but lets go do it to clear it off the board.

Its pretty clear to me now; when you finish contracts, new ones pop up. Odd that refresh contracts mod wont help on that, so its not that contracts are queued but "hidden". Also contracts that popped up are not for the SAME field I just worked. Right now I finished one tiny cultivating contract and another cultivating and fertilizing contract appeared. So its good to do contracts even though some of them are silly for mere few thousand as reward. I mean if you want to do lucrative contracts, its good to do the crappy ones too.
</p>

<p>
I was passing by dealership so purchased 5 1k liter fertilizer pallets to top of bredal k105. I mean, why not if we are passing right by it, no reason to drive around 63% full fertilizer tank.

Did quick calculation of all the seeding contracts available now, rewards come to 537.2k which is a lot. I was thinking that going to buy steiger and seed hawk, but that idea was crushed quickly when I checked that kitted out steiger costs 557k, so yeah maybe we need to find different seeding equipment or forget about this dream.

1359 Seed hawk out of seeds
</p>

<p>
Okay so big bud 747 only goes like 32km/h which is dead slow. I'm going to buy dirt cheap grain trailer and haul seeds using it to the seed hawk.
</p>

<p>
1400 Purchased strautmann SEK 802, 12k liter capacity for 12k
</p>

<p>
Loaded seed pallets to SEK 802, then drove them to seed hawk at F67. It was slow going because john deere 6155M top speed is 43km/h, but its better than driving monster big bud 747 back and forth. If I courseplay for seed hawk then I could always haul seeds while its running, so anytime it runs out or field is completed I could top if off.
</p>

<p>
Also I can make courseplay routes for this seed tender 6155M and keep it running constantly if necessary, which is not needed of course but gives me hands free to watch twitch live streams or youtube videos, or just simply write this text <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

So I took a break to cook and eat food, during this time big bud 747 finished seeding F24, I started bredal k105 to fertilize F271 and worst of all, night has fallen, in-game 1852hrs and its almost pitch black dark.

Oh man this was really scary field work as I could not see anything, you can just make out horizon but in-game 1904hrs it is basically pitch black dark night now. I cannot work like this, even to drive big bud 747 with seed hawk ON ROADS using minimap gets you easily tangled up with utility poles.

<p>
I managed to carefully drive seed hawk into vehicle shop, but this area was so dark at night I had no way to refill seeds to it even though it would have been the perfect time while fertilizing contract is still running.

Big Bud 747 / Seed Hawk which are leased have condition so bad that speed has dropped from 18km/h to 16km/h. Its a bad idea to lease vehicles for such large scale contract work, well any work but you usually don't lease stuff for your own field work.

<p>
That is it, seeding contracts are done from my part. There is still one on the board but I'm not going to take it, feels like my leased equipment is running on last breath heh. New contracts pop up just when you think all of them are finished, so its never ending loop. I assume eventually seeding contracts end because season/year is over, but yeah overall it feels like never ending.
</p>

<p>
Going to drive big bud 747 with seed hawk back to dealership, unload seeds and then finally return them.
</p>

<p>
I'm quite exhausted, not sure if this is momentarily being tired kind of exhaustion or just that I'm bored of this savegame. I have no mental energy right now to proceed doing more contracts of any kind, even lucrative fertilization contracts would not appeal to me.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.926m which is quite amazing. Cannot remember the last time in Start From Zero careers when I got this much money on such short time, or maybe I don't remember, anyways.
</p>

<p>
0346 Unloaded seeds and returned leased vehicles, finally.

<p>
09/late-autumn in-game 1631hrs, time accelerate to the next day.

<p>
01/early-winter in-game 0812hrs, two new fertilization contracts appeared but as written above I was just like blah.

<p>
Decided to go take a nap as I had no feeling to farm right now, hopefully after waking up refreshed I have motivation to decide what to do with this savegame next.
</p>

<p>
0352 Shut down FS19, its nap time...
</p>

<p>
0630 Booting FS19 back up, lets see how this would go now.

<p>
Budget now 2.082m yeah buddy! Two million! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Contracts board is empty of fertilizing contracts, plenty of contracts left but they are couple of seeding ones and many cultivating ones.
</p>

<p>
Restarted FS19, I wanted to see if new contracts appear, this savegame now has 60hrs 7mins in it. Nope, no new contracts appeared and refresh contracts did not do nothing either.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm wondering deep thoughts... what to do next... I have 2 million of money, I could buy a land lot, F15 would be cheapest in literally NE corner, I could easily get all the cheapest vehicles which would be torture, I might be able to buy medium sized vehicles as well, need to calculate specifics after buying the field.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure if I want to continue playing this savegame because I was not supposed to play on PMC Iowa Garden City 8km in the first place, not to mention Start From Zero, hence I call this "unofficial" heh. I have had a great time playing though, not sure if I properly conveyed through this story text, but continuing from here when this terrain is not finished and this savegame was sort of hastily created as unofficial... dunno I don't like it at all. I don't want to play until this terrains vegetation placement is finished AND PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero is finished.
</p>

<p>
At the same time... what else would I do today, not feeling like editing and have full rest of the day, well days, left to play and enjoy my time with PMC terrain. Hmm am I making any sense? Dunno <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright enough with the nonsense, lets see some practical farming development in this savegame. Some conclusions from contracts game-play mode if you will.
</p>

<p>
Seasons causes AI's to offer so many CULTIVATING contracts. Its clear to me that having a powerful/fast cultivator equipment fleet would help a lot. Once you finish cultivating contracts it opens fertilizing and seeding contracts. Oddly enough I have seen NO herbicide spraying contracts, only one for weeding.
</p>

<p>
With 2 million I could easily buy good cultivating fleet with additional smaller fertilizing equipment. That cult-fert contract loop would definitely keep me busy and get me a lot of money.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking about owning tractors and wide cultivators so at least two vehicles would work a single contract, this way the time used would be cut very short, well depending on field size of course.
</p>

<p>
Seeding equipment is also important, if I have powerful cultivating tractors then I would not need to buy more of them as I could just use tractors to pull any seeder(s) I have.
</p>

<p>
01/early-winter in-game 1053hrs, decided to skip one day just to kind of clear the contracts board, maybe something new pops up. Also looking forward to go over the winter into next spring soon, that should rejuvenate contracts. BTW in this savegame I have only used 600 speed time acceleration JUST in case there is no sync issues with field stage switches.
</p>

<p>
02/early-winter in-game 0821hrs. Oh my, we got new contracts; 5 fertilizing and 2 cultivating.
</p>

<p>
Okay lets make some decisions that impact this savegame: I'm going to accept all those fertilizing contracts and finish them, I will not accept any more if new ones should appear. Once these are finished, then I count my money and make final decision about land and equipment purchase. Lets do this.
</p>

<p>
0917 Accepted contract for fertilizing F233, F25, F78, F251, F85<br>
0927 Started fertilizing F78, contract. courseplay ETA 28min
</p>

<p>
After taking these contracts I got to think that yes these are very nice rewards overall, but what impact does it make on top of the existing 2.082m I have money right now, I mean what would change with me doing these contracts. Haven't bothered to count them together, will see the final budget once they are done. But overall big picture, I might have just skipped these and bought land and equipment right away to start farming on my own, or do more contracts with good contract vehicles.
</p>

<p>
My john deere 6155M is running out of fuel, there are no fuel station in this version of the terrain and I have no land to put placeable fuel station down.
</p>

<p>
0931 Purchased fuel station placeable for 5.9k
</p>

<p>
Oh what do you know, with placeanywhere mod I could actually use that fuel station placeable, I set it on dealership. Nice, now I can refuel my vehicle. Heck I might buy fertilizer buying station as well, hmm or not, that is best to leave after I setup my own farm on my own land. Anyways now I have no fuel issues with my vehicles anymore.
</p>

<p>
Then it was lunch break, I'm starving again. Hopefully manage to feed while this courseplay course runs.
</p>

<p>
0936 Lunch break...<br>
0955 Finished fertilizing F78, contract, collected contract reward 45.6k.<br>
0957 Feeding is over, back to fertilizing contracts
</p>

<p>
When I accepted reward from F78 contract a new small fertilizing contract appeared. I'll stick to my word, wont be taking any more contracts, just finish these active ones and then we move on to buy equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1003 Started fertilizing F168, contract. courseplay ETA 18min<br>
1019 Finished fertilizing F168, contract, collected contract reward 25k.
</p>

<p>
Refueled 6155M by the dealership <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1023 Purchased 11 1k liter fertilizer pallets<br>
1029 Started fertilizing F85, contract. courseplay ETA 6min<br>
1034 Finished fertilizing F85, contract, collected contract reward 7.1k.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed contracts and more fertilizing ones appeared, so darn tempting as they were good money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1045 Started fertilizing F251, contract. courseplay ETA 47min
</p>

<p>
Yes I said I wont be taking anymore fertilizing contracts because it now seems to be like never ending loop, however F254 is very nice contract and right close by where we are fertilizing F251 currently, so come on... I just <i>had</i> to take it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1047 Accepted contract for fertilizing F254<br>
1103 Finished fertilizing F251, contract, collected contract reward 33.9k.<br>
1104 Started fertilizing F254, contract. courseplay ETA 35min<br>
1130 Finished fertilizing F254, contract, collected contract reward 38.8k.<br>
1137 Started fertilizing F233, contract. courseplay ETA 23min<br>
1200 Finished fertilizing F233, contract, collected contract reward 32k.
</p>

<p>
Well there was one quite large fertilizing contract and still had fertilizer in the tank so could not resist, had to take it BUT THEN its over, this is the last one! Honest! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
1204 Accepted contract for fertilizing F188<br>
1215 Started fertilizing F188, contract. courseplay ETA 27min<br>
1245 Finished fertilizing F188, contract, collected contract reward 44.4k.
</p>

<p>
After accepting reward from F188 contract, yes you guessed it, more fertilizing contracts appeared. This time tiny and another was 15k so it wasn't so tempting especially as it was in the other side of the terrain.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 2.281m. As I kind of suspected several hours ago, what do I gain if I take these fertilizing contracts, well I went from 82k to 281k, so how many hours of work and 200k gain, hmm? Clearly it was waste of time, I mean 200k is nothing, sure you can buy one type of several small implements, but its not enough for a tractor AND implement. So all in all while its okay addition to our budget it really didn't change anything I can do right now, which I could have already done several hours ago, get it? Good <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Here we are, decision time, what to do, how to start our own farm or better our contract company so to speak. Of course I am interested of buying land and starting our own farm, to work on our own fields and finally start to get some real steady income without having to rely on time acceleration and hopes that tomorrow we get fertilizing contracts again.
</p>

<p>
It would be pretty cool to purchase couple of rubicon 9000's, liquid fertilizer tanker truck and just start to do fertilizing contracts only. In big picture I'm sure it would make the best profits for hours used, especially if I blast in 6000 speed time acceleration.
</p>

<p>
While these two last contracts were running I was GIMP editing farmland image, to add many smaller more detailed pieces of land to buy so these kind of starter careers are easier for players short on money. Previously pretty much all our fields were full sections, ie 240ha chunks between road grid boxes.
</p>

<p>
Well I don't know if its a good or bad decision but its a decision, I'm going to buy the medium sized vehicle fleet and land lot with F15 on it.
</p>

<p>
1313 Purchased land lot with F15 on it for 351.6k
</p>

<pre>
- plow 300hp 12km/h 4.9m lemken titan 18 59k
- cultivator 300hp 15km/h 6m horsch tiger 6dt 39k

<p>
Purchased the above list. Budget now 704k.
</p>

<p>
Purchased placeables for farm yard:
</p>
<pre>
- meridian lime bulk bin 10k
- giants liquid fertilizer tank 8.5k
- giants fertilizer tank 8.5k
- giants herbicide tank 8.5k
- giants seed tank 8.5k
- pmc farm silo large 10m liters 180k
</pre>

<p>
Budget now 480.8k. Great buffer money to start our own farming.
</p>

<p>
Next I started to haul this large fleet of equipment to my farm area. Used pickup truck 1978 to drive dirty courseplay course from shop to F15.
</p>

<p>
And when I say decision was good or bad, I mean... whats changed really, if I want to do more contracts like previously I can still continue doing it, I just now have less money but more equipment. For example that bigger john deere tractor and bredal k165 greatly increases our fertilizing contract potential. Rest of the equipment of course is pretty bad, I would not take cultivator contracts with that crappy horsch 6m nonsense heh. Also technically we could now do harvest contracts, but I doubt thats going to happen.
</p>

<p>
While growing our farm it was silly purchase but I had to buy silo display large for our farm bin silo heh.
</p>

<p>
1350 I'm just sensing the incredible time sink that this decision was.
</p>

<p>
Meaning that just by hauling these equipment from shop to F15 which is now our new farm, is taking so long. I bet that when I start to cultivate or plow our first field its duration is like HOUR+ for sure.
</p>

<p>
1419 Started fertilizing F15, courseplay ETA 49min
</p>

<p>
Goodness gracious fertilizing with 30m spreader takes 49 minutes!? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I told ya ... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright so this land area is 37ha and not sure how much smaller the field is, it is somewhat smaller but I wouldn't say very much. So guess this 49min is quite much expected outcome of field work even with 2 * 30m width. I have to assume that since this field is now fallow and we plant soybeans, the yield will be quite substantial and kicks us off to a great start money wise.
</p>

<p>
1450 Finished fertilizing F15
</p>

<p>
I brought in the smaller bredal K105 to help on that fertilizing task.
</p>

<p>
1454 Started lime spreading F15, courseplay ETA 3h 11min, 2x tools
</p>

<p>
What the hell THREE HOURS? But once I started second vehicle on the course it then said 44 minutes, so dunno whats up with the timer on the first one.
</p>

<pre>
- cultivator 400hp 20m john deere 2410 5 section 75k

<p>
1501 Purchased above list, budget now 35.9k
</p>

<p>
I mean I just couldn't live with those piece of garbage cultivators and plows, its just not me, I'm not going to spend 4+ hours working on our first field hehe. Oh yeah sold those mentioned things and budget now 133.9k.
</p>

<p>

<p>
1613 Finished fertilizing F15
</p>

<p>
Next was plowing F15 and I was already scared, as you can see below courseplay duration was close to two frigging hours, uuh that is so long wait that I am pretty much ready for bed time when this finishes assuming courseplay timer is accurate (I think it takes far longer with the turns). So yeah here we are again, endless time sink of FS19.
</p>

<p>
1616 Started ploughing F15, courseplay ETA 1h 49min
</p>

<p>
After starting that course I didn't know what to do, I was kind of depressed of these long field work durations, I had imagined I could start to seed soybeans today but with this field size no way its going to happen, I fall asleep long before all field work is done.
</p>

<p>
Also I had zero interest to just sit here and watch big bud 450 pull john deere 2623 plowing this field so I took all the remaining fertilization contracts and went after those with my bredal spreaders.
</p>

<p>
1621 Accepted contract for fertilizing F43, F229, F118<br>
1637 Started fertilizing F43, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1639 Finished fertilizing F43, contract, collected contract reward 1.8k.<br>
1640 Started fertilizing F118, contract, manually with GPS<br>
1644 Finished fertilizing F118, contract, collected contract reward 5.7k.
</p>

<p>
As I expected, after accepting reward for this contract I got more fertilization contracts, two of them with decent rewards.
</p>

<p>
02/early-winter in-game 1745hrs, skipping the night. 03/early-winter in-game 0840hrs, daylight again.
</p>

<p>
Now we are at end of the season, for our situation at least. Nothing left to do other than time accelerate until next year begins and we can start to do more contracts.
</p>

<p>
Several fertilizing contracts appeared, nothing super crazy but 37, 16, 8, 2 and 13k rewards, pretty okay of course depending how widely spaced out the fields are (didn't check). Strange part is that ground temperature is 0C and its my understanding that at least in -1C you cannot fertilize anymore.
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate, I'm pretty exhausted of fertilizing contracts heh. Decided to switch to my normal 6000 speed time accelerating so I don't have to wait for that long, I'm not desperate for fertilizing contracts so lets speed things up (guessing it might cause problems).
</p>

<p>
04/mid-winter in-game 0946hrs, weather -0C/0C, heh.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-winter in-game 0855hrs, weather -2/-1C and now ground if frozen, not that I'd be interested of trying out those active fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
09/late-winter in-game 0912hrs, weather -1/+0C.
</p>

<p>
Hmm end of the year. Okay so its getting late in real life for me, not tired yet but because everything takes forever in farmsim there is nothing I could do today that would matter or I could finish without being in full zombi mode, so I decided to save game here at end of the year so IF, if I might do some edits to the terrain I could easily port over seasons savegame now.
</p>

<p>
1859 Time to call it a night, no idea what happens tomorrow...
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-02-24T0238</b> Last farming day has started, this savegame now has 70hrs 2min in it.
<p>

<p>
Wait, last day? huh what? Yup I decided that because PMC Iowa Garden City 8km has vegetation object placement incomplete plus a lot of other terrain editing work not done, this savegame is unofficial in the first place... that I will end playing it today. I'm hoping to seed and harvest on todays farming session and once its completed, I exit and cold heartedly delete this savegame dir.
</p>

<p>
I should not be playing this terrain as its unfinished, I should not be starting new career savegames until PMC Grande Gardens 16km Start From Zero is finished, yet here I am doing just that. I don't feel good about that at all. This is why I'm bringing this savegame to an end today, no matter what stage it is in.
</p>

<p>
01/early-spring in-game 0825hrs, weather +8/+3C. Same five fertilizing contracts there but I'm not going to bother with them.
</p>

<p>
06/mid-spring in-game 0829hrs, weather +10/+10C. One of the fertilizing contracts has now disappered (after 6000 time accelerating several days).
</p>

<p>
0300 Started seeding F15, courseplay ETA 2h 37min
</p>

<p>
Oh boy that field work duration again. Just wondering how many refills this field is going to take, horsch pronto 9dc takes 5k liters of seed. Luckily our farm bin silo has seeds in it and its right middle of the field. But yeah, now we wait and watch twitch/youtube in the mean time.
</p>

<p>
0419 Refilled horsch pronto 9dc with another 5k liters of seeds<br>
0529 Finished seeding F15
</p>

<p>
Time acceleration until field got germinated, then off to spray some herbicide.
</p>

<p>
0536 Started spraying herbicide F15, courseplay ETA 1h 2min
</p>

<p>
And then I got so tired was snoozing off while watching herbicide getting sprayed, decided to take a nap.
</p>

<p>
0807 Nap time is over, back to farming
</p>

<p>
Watching that 12km/h herbicide sprayer going back and forth on a field is rather boring, that speed is so slow it just puts me to sleep. Rubicon 9000 would be so much nicer, also 400k more expensive hehe. But yeah this is the same age old problem I'm having with FS19 that its such a time sink. I'm tempted to take those four fertilizing contracts that are still on the board just to see if they are actually working contracts instead of some winter to spring time acceleration ghosts.
</p>

<p>
0831 Accepted contract for fertilizing F173, F47, F48, F154<br>
0850 Started fertilizing F47, contract, courseplay ETA 11min<br>
0850 Finished spraying herbicide F15
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to cook food and eat.
</p>

<p>
0915 Finished fertilizing F47, contract, collected contract reward 16.4k.
</p>

<p>
During cooking food or perhaps when I accepted reward for F47 contract, several seeding contracts appeared. I have no intention of taking them and leasing big seeder again, but looks like spring planting season is in full swing on PMC Iowa Garden City 8km.
</p>

<p>
0919 Started fertilizing F48, contract, courseplay ETA 6min<br>
0927 Finished fertilizing F48, contract, collected contract reward 8k.<br>
0944 Feeding time over, back to farming<br>
0957 Started fertilizing F173, contract, courseplay ETA 15min, 2x tools<br>
1011 Finished fertilizing F173, contract, collected contract reward 37.2k.<br>
1015 Started fertilizing F154, contract, courseplay ETA 5min, 2x tools<br>
1021 Finished fertilizing F154, contract, collected contract reward 13.6k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 202.9k.
</p>

<p>
1115 Started harvesting soybeans F15, courseplay ETA 2h 59min<br>
1414 Finished harvesting soybeans F15
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo has about 298k liters of soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Plan was to sell these soybeans to see how much money we get, I am not tired yet but honestly I've seen this dance way too many times; I would need to time accelerate into MID SUMMER next year to sell these soybeans and the selling alone would take a long time hauling with a semi truck, then... I would just see the amount of money and that is it, then this savegame would go to delete. So I'm just not going to do that.
</p>

<p>
This savegame ended up having 79 hours and 29 minutes in it. Final budget was 201.7k in cash and as mentioned 298k liters of soybeans. Should be easy to estimate final budget by soybean best price.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-02-24T1428</b> Deleted savegame1 which is this save, everything is lost!
</p>

<p>
Heh yep, you gotta do what you gotta do, I wasn't supposed to be playing in this terrain yet not to mention Start From Zero so there you have it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
