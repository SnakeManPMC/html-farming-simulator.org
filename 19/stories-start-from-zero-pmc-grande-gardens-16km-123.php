	<h2>2022-07-15 Soybeans Harvest Irregular Shape F141</h2>

<p>
2022-07-15T03:16:33Z New farming day has started, woke up after good 7hrs+ sleep, did the morning chores, ate days first meal, now about to fire up FS19. First I took backup of savegame1 dir just in case.
</p>

<p>
Today I'll continue harvesting that big stupidly shaped long field, yeah I was thinking about it this morning and will have to re-design that field because it has so many things going wrong with it, I'll make it different shape, add dirt road on W-NW side of it, add some trees perhaps between railroad and the dirt road maybe. Like the field is on v1.1.14 courseplay just makes a crazy mess of any harvester "lands" course.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 1091hrs 33min on it, the hours just keep stacking up, heh.
</p>

2022-07-15T03:20:34Z Start From Zero savegame loaded, lets start harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
02/mid-autumn in-game 1132hrs, weather +15C/+13C, forecast clear.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-15T03:24:30Z All harvesters are cutting, semi-truck grain trailer is running under autodrive, grain cart tractor is up, I'm harvesting...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-15T04:26:33Z And of course once lead harvester reached end of the course, remaining harvesters did "empty tour" aka victory loop, a very long way without cutting anything, just wasting perfectly good farming time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I don't know man, just wanted to get some nice relaxing Start From Zero farming game-play but all this just makes me frustrated and angry when courseplay acts up and wastes my time. I'm seriously considering again to switch playing Elite Dangerous, at least there I know exactly what I'm getting when exploring and mining, flying around in Fleet Carrier 30k light years away from sol aka the shit hole.
</p>

<p>
There is still one full pass left on F141 harvest, but dunno... I think I'll switch to elite after this is done...
