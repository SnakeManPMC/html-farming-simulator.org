	<h2>2022-07-24 Difficult Field Shape Courseplay Issues</h2>

<p>
2022-07-24T11:01:27Z New farming day has started, first took backups of this savegame, then fired up FS19. This savegame now has 1093hrs 7min in it. Todays goal is simple, continue the harvest season where I left off week ago.
</p>

<p>
Drove first lexion 8900 to the next field and recorded courseplay deleteme course, then send three other combines using that course. Looking at F140 and F139, they look awfully small and narrow, they don't have that easy going 4 combine field work vibe, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Then refueled semi-trucks and combines. Next set semi-truck grain trailers into autodrive route from "F140 W" to SP3 dumping.
</p>

<p>
Honestly I was depressed when looking at F140 shape, it has that point-y south edge which will cause problems for courseplay field work course. But gotta get it started, decided to go with four combines, I mean why break the format... who cares if it goes all to hell, lets just start cutting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Saved game before starting to generate courseplay course, have too many bad experiences to ignore savegames.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T11:25:26Z Started harvesting F140, 4 tools courseplay, ETA 25min.
</p>

<p>
Had courseplay issue on combine number four, it would not start from first waypoint, gave error in the log, then on nearest waypoint it went into combine need to be unloaded even though it wasnt even ten percent full yet. I love playing farming simulator but sometimes these courseplay issues drive me out of my fucking mind <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Emptying ...
</p>

<p>
Once combines (1-3) did first headland I jumped into number four and started to manually cut some soybeans while waiting the other combines to fill up. Of course it was not long after when this happened...
</p>

<p>
Oh well, lets go untangle that courseplay mess...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T11:53:10Z I must say at this point my frustration level was sky high again, no I didn't feel like rage quitting yet, but I am SO going to remove these narrow point field corners because they are the first sign of trouble when it comes to courseplay course generation. Yes they wont solve all issues, but at least its a start.
</p>

<p>
Manual driving...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T12:00:26Z Finished harvesting F140.
</p>

<p>
Well that didn't take long, but sure was frustrating, I did 20% of the field driving manually heh. Next I have F139 which is same size and shape, I am actually going old school and do this field with a single combine, sorry but I am so fucking pissed off right now that I don't want ANY fuckups on the next field.
</p>

<p>
This is the single combine field work course for F139, it will take a while... but at least there wont be any collision fuckups to untangle.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T12:06:09Z Started harvesting soybeans F139, courseplay ETA 1hrs 5min.
</p>

<p>
Uh oh single combine one hour field work course, heh. Wonder if this was a good idea after all, might actually cause more problems as the next field which is more square size, will be done with 3 combines.. so yeah dunno, its one big shit pile today it seems <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This is F138 courseplay field work course using 3 tools, hmph.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T12:10:32Z Started harvesting soybeans F138, 3x tools courseplay ETA 1hrs 10min.
</p>

<p>
Look at that view...
</p>

<p>
While harvesting F138 was thinking of simply removing the NW corner narrow part and place grain bins there, everyone loves grain bins.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-07-24T13:18:58Z Finished harvesting F139.
</p>

<p>
Hmm feels like quick harvest for F139, or maybe time just flies when you get to work, dunno. Was looking at map a bit, so happy to see F137 and F88 almost perfect squares, no issues with courseplay field work course generation at all. I'm also happy to finish this harvest season today, have plenty of time as my day has just started. Getting this SE corner region harvested will be a very nice feeling.
</p>

<p>
Actually I'm thinking about upgrading PMC Grande Gardens 16km once again, to remove those narrow field sports or corners, they are so annoying that there is no justification to have them in such huge open landscape terrain like this. So next farming session might just be on new terrain version, remains to be seen.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T13:34:42Z And JUST as I got into better mood... there is courseplay vehicle collision and one combine is off the board again, no idea which fucking lane its his now, well I mean yes I know its the number one combine, lead vehicle, but it doesn't continue on the correct lane/waypoint. AAARGH! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T13:45:30Z Finished harvesting soybeans F138.
</p>

<p>
This course is not perfect either, I can see there is collision spots, but oh well at least its a square field.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T13:55:49Z Started harvesting F137, 4x tools courseplay ETA 47min.
</p>

<p>
Harvesting...

<p>
After combines did headland... they did a victory loop with headers down cutting... but it was the already cut headland, so ... complete and utter waste of time. This is another thing that really pisses me off with courseplay. No idea if it could be avoided somehow with field work generation settings, like make starting point into some specific corner of the field or something, dunno. But yeah it is extremely frustrating to sit on your hands waiting for MISTER COMBINEZ to fucking finish that useless empty loop <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Imagine how much time is wasted on these empty victory loops on a REALLY large fields...
</p>

<p>
Was looking at lead combines field work course if there would be any indication why this empty loop, but I couldn't decipher it, course looks fine to me, I see no reason to do one empty loop. But I'll try to keep an eye on the starting position in field and maybe I could find some way to avoid these empty loops.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of terrain upgrade and spicing this old savegame up a bit... I want to bring in the seasons GEO "Hot Snow" which makes summers hot and winters snowy. In short, I want winters to be cold and snowy, I hate default US midwest GEO when it basically never snows.
</p>

<p>
F137 harvest yielded huge amounts, was surprised how quickly lexion 8900s grain tanks got full, checked mapview and sure enough this field was plowed and one stage of fertilized, might have had not too much weeds too. The difference in yield was crazy compared to <i>"I don't care"</i> planted crop. F88 is the same, it will yield decent.
</p>

<p>
Last pass...
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T14:51:41Z Finished harvesting soybeans F137.
</p>

<p>
Even though this day started with profanities when infuriated by courseplay mess, now its my lunch time just as this field finished harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I saved game and let semi-truck grain trailer haul the current load, its in-game 1651hrs so getting a bit late but no biggie, time is no issue, I'll let FS19 game run while I cook and eat food.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T15:35:32Z Feeding done, back to harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Did 5 headland pass course generation, it only generated 3, hopefully this works better.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T15:47:52Z Started harvesting soybeans F88, 4x tools courseplay ETA 35min.
</p>

<p>
Getting it done.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2022-07-24T1550.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2022-07-24T1550.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Grande Gardens 16km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
There was some issue with vehicle number four, it lagged far behind others, hmm odd.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T16:23:25Z Yeah that vehicle really fucked up, its course is ruined, dunno what the hell happened. Goodbye good mood again, fucking courseplay problems <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T16:30:45Z Had to manually drive vehicle number four, I was just about had it at this point <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Last (manual) pass...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2022-07-24T1638.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/PMC-Grande-Gardens-16km-2022-07-24T1638.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Grande Gardens 16km Farming Simulator 19 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-07-24T16:40:16Z Finished harvesting soybeans F88. Harvest season is done! Whohoo! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then just parked vehicles, waited a bit while semi-truck grain trailer was hauling last load to selling point 3.
</p>

<p>
2022-07-24T16:49:48Z Saved game and shut down FS19, it was good to get this harvest season and SE region's fields done.
