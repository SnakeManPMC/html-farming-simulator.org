<p>
2021-06-05T06:40:00Z Compiled PMC_Iowa_Garden_City_8km_v1.1.7.7z for internal testing.
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-06-12</b> Seasons GEO iowa garden city increased winter clouds, rain chance and amount of rain. Gotta make winters HARD <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>2021-06-13</b> Floydno9 had reported that with our seasons GEO iowa garden city sugar beets cannot be harvested. So I started new savegame and.. well let me copy paste my play-by-play report here below, I didn't write it dev diary in mind so be aware of that.
</p>

<p>
Started new savegame, 9 day seasons. 01/early-spring in-game 0835hrs, weather -2C/+4C. Lets start.
</p>

<p>
Had to time accelerate until soil temperature reached +5C which is sugar beet planting temperature. I'm using my standard 6000 speed time acceleration.
</p>

<p>
02/early-spring in-game 0817hrs, weather -0C/+2C.<br>
03/early-spring in-game 0746hrs, weather -2C/+2C.<br>
04/mid-spring in-game 0748hrs, weather +6C/+3C.<br>
05/mid-spring in-game 0803hrs, weather +9C/+6C. Its now sugar beet planting time.
</p>

<p>
Got sugar beets planted, next was just to time accelerate until they are harvest ready... or wither?
</p>

<p>
06/mid-spring in-game 0742hrs, weather +7C. After few real life minutes sugar beets got germinated.<br>
07/late-spring in-game 0747hrs, weather +12C/+10C. After few real life minutes sugar beets are growing (green plants appeared).<br>
08/late-spring in-game 0724hrs, weather +12C/+11C.<br>
09/late-spring in-game 0713hrs, weather +13C.<br>
01/early-summer in-game 0655hrs, weather +13C/+14C.<br>
02/early-summer in-game 0710hrs, weather +14C/+16C. Second growth stage kicked in, green plants increased in size.<br>
03/early-summer in-game 0650hrs, weather +14C/+16C.<br>
04/mid-summer in-game 0649hrs, weather +17C.<br>
05/mid-summer in-game 0709hrs, weather +19C. Another growth stage kicked in.<br>
06/mid-summer in-game 0710hrs, weather +16C/+20C.<br>
07/late-summer in-game 0731hrs, weather +17C/+20C.<br>
08/late-summer in-game 0739hrs, weather +16C/+20C.<br>
09/late-summer in-game 0747hrs, weather +16C/+19C.<br>
01/early-autumn in-game 0754hrs, weather +15C/+19C.<br>
02/early-autumn in-game 0841hrs, weather +12C/+17C.<br>
03/early-autumn in-game 0810hrs, weather +14C/+16C.<br>
04/mid-autumn in-game 0814hrs, weather +6C/+13C. First day of sugar beets harvest season.<br>
05/mid-autumn in-game 0859hrs, weather +8C/+12C. Growth stage is: remove tops. This is before half way to harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion is that at least for me with the latest seasons GEO, I can get into "remove tops" stage just fine, I assume that is the harvest ready stage.
</p>
