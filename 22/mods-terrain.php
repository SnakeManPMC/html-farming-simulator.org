<p>
FS22 Spring Creek terrain, or a Hastings North Dakota remake, whatever, as a lot of people liked the hastings map I decided to remake it from zero and make it bigger and better, the terrain features a lot of things, including a stunning landscape, a town, a BGA plant, fields variating from small to HUGE, some forests, a lot of trees, and a lot more things!
</p>

<p>
Also the terrain is Anhydrous Ready (Credits to son_of_ragnar_iv), Robin Melia also he helped me a LOT with the terrain and also was one of the people that made this terrain possible.

Terrain itself in-game looks real nice and cozy, very rough cool looking elevations, however this apparently is unfinished prototype alike terrain which needs more work especially fixing all the errors in the log, once that work has been done this might be a nice little cozy terrain to play with small equipment. AFB's website reads: "This is a prototype micro map to test how HUGE gdm files perform on small maps".

<p>
FS22_Belgium.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: 2023-08-29T04:15:00Z Tested. What an imaginative name again. Huge amount of required mods: -1970sCowshed, -BigDairyDecoPackage, -CowshedsPack2, -DutchContractorShed, -DutchShedPack, -FarmSilosDirty, -fertilizerTank, -fuelStation, -HouseOldPackage, -shedModernColourable, -SilageSilo, -slurryPit, -Small_ManureHeap, -sugarbeetProcessing01, -Elektrisches_Schiebetor. Nothing wrong with a lot of required mods, its good that community made content is being used especially if it avoids idiots putting other peoples models / textures into their own terrain project directory which never ever should be done. None of these required mods has check in the config that they are loaded, so if a user does not load these required mods then buildings or features etc are missing, terrain dev should always add required mod config list. Terrain is 4km yes but actual usable land is only half of it, this kind of bizarre round plot of land. I did not test this terrain properly, didn't bother hunt down and download all those required mods, especially as there is not even required mod check in the config. I don't know if log has errors because I did not use required mods, this test is incomplete, just reporting what I can see so far.

<p>
Notes: 2023-08-29T04:26:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. Before even testing this terrain I knew that this one was made by using <a href="pmc-redwhiteblue-10km.php" target="_blank">PMC RedWhiteBlue 10km</a> terrain source files without any credit, no acknowledgement given to PMC at all. I cannot be sure so maybe I should not make assumptions but PDA_MAP images outside terrain aka background image is from elmcreek. Has elmcreek water tower with "Big Fields" texture on it, nice. Has huge open giants vehicle sheds which are basic but still cool. Heightmap looks completely RGB blacked out flat. Buildings are from elmcreek mapUS which is fine, but in some ways it just feels like all elmcreek production and grain bin site buildings were stamped down in a big group or line, kind of way... again nothing really wrong about it, but perhaps these buildings should have been spread out across the terrain to make it more interesting, this is just an personal opinion nothing wrong with this terrains building placement. What I mean by copy-pasted is that I recognize building layouts from elmcreek, so these are mostly just copy-pasted from elmcreek and positioned in this new terrain (again, nothing wrong about using mapUS stuff, but yeah just saying). Most buildings have large empty areas around them. Buying all the farmland gives you no more placeable buildings. F10 is 2956ha in size, that is impressive hehe, in FS22 I didn't make fields of that size because I think that people think its just dumb to make a mass blob field and call it a day, that is why <a href="pmc-terrains.php">PMC Terrains FS22</a> have curvy funky shaped fields (with two exceptions). I love the central grain bin site as its just huge, I know its cosmetic stuff but man it looks impressive, a real big boy stuff heh. Has quite large BGA site and another on the other end of building row (I'm not expert on BGAs so what do I know). Uses one erlengrat building according to its sign on the side. I have plenty of my own huge terrains to play, but if I were to play some user made large scale stuff, well this actually could be one option, in this you have many things I don't like but I rather play on this 10.2km x 10.2km terrain than in some piece of shit BRITISH MAPZ trash. Also big bonus is no errors no issues, cant never appreciate that enough.

	<h2>Clarkson US 4km</h2>

<p>
v2.1 by MN99, MN97, MartinN". From modDesc: The main focus of the map is on the large and wide fields in order to push the big machines to their limits, especially in multiplayer. In order to make every player happy, the map has also been decorated with smaller to medium-sized fields. The map has 24 fields and nine large forest areas. There are also six ponds. Between the vivid and varied wooded areas and arable land, the cultivation of wine and olives in the farming simulator 2022 should not be missing. To harvest olives or grapes, 20 buyable plantations were created. In addition, four poplar plantations were established. A large part of the production chains have also been integrated into the map. If this is not enough, there is enough space to place buildings yourself. Despite the size, great attention was paid to detail and accuracy to ensure the best possible gaming experience. The map is suitable for multiplayer and collectibles have been installed.
