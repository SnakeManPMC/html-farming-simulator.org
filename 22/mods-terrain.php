<p>
FS22 Spring Creek terrain, or a Hastings North Dakota remake, whatever, as a lot of people liked the hastings map I decided to remake it from zero and make it bigger and better, the terrain features a lot of things, including a stunning landscape, a town, a BGA plant, fields variating from small to HUGE, some forests, a lot of trees, and a lot more things!
</p>

<p>
Also the terrain is Anhydrous Ready (Credits to son_of_ragnar_iv), Robin Melia also he helped me a LOT with the terrain and also was one of the people that made this terrain possible.
