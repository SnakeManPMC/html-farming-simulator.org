	<h2>Playing Guide</h2>

<p>
<b>2021-11-20T15:51:00Z</b> updated. This page is SPECULATION until after 2021-11-21T23:00:00Z when we get to activate the game and try this info ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="../guide.php">Farming Simulator 17 Guide</a> and <a href="../19/guide.php">Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) Guide</a> first as we do not repeat the same stuff in this tutorial unless it has been changed.
</p>


	<h2>Production Chains</h2>

<p>
Production chains are good old factories, where you produce your own goods. There is a long history in FS17 and FS19 for generating fertilizer, seeds, etc along with more complex goods which can then be further used in other factories.
</p>

<p>
For more details please read <a href="guide-production-chains.php">FS22 Playing Guide Production Chains</a>.
</p>


	<h2>Rock Picking</h2>

<p>
Back in FS19 ThundR created a mod for rock picking, now this is an in-game Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) feature. Giants call this "stone picking" but all real life youtube farming videos use rock picking terminology.
</p>

<p>
When you work the fields small patches of rocks appear. If you do not pick up these rocks they will damage your vehicles which drive over them, seeder, planter, combine harvester etc.
</p>

<p>
Purchase rock picker (stone picker) from the store, use your tractor to pull it and work the field to collect these rocks. You can sell or dump these rocks to get rid of them. Money you get from selling rocks is very little, you do not get rich by selling rocks.
