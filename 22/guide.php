	<h2>Production Chains</h2>

<p>
Production chains are good old factories, where you produce your own goods. There is a long history in FS17 and FS19 for generating fertilizer, seeds, etc along with more complex goods which can then be further used in other factories.

	<h2>Rock Picking</h2>

<p>
Back in FS19 ThundR created a mod for rock picking, now this is an in-game Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) feature. Giants call this "stone picking" but all real life youtube farming videos use rock picking terminology.
