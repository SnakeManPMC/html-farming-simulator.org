	<h2>2022-09-27 Day After Massive Grain Sale</h2>

<p>
2022-09-27T19:02:00Z New farming day has started, just woke up, did morning computer chores, updated courseplay and checked other mod news nothing there. Then update (kinda) better contracts mod, its config file and enabled debug. Also configured RealClock mod a bit. Took backup of savegames and now loaded this savegame up, forgot to check how many hours it is, OK next time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now getting some better contracts mod info on the game log file:

<p>
Hooked up bredal k165 and fendt 1050 vario, refilled it too. Then refilled fendt 939 vario bredal k165 and fendt favorit 515c bredal k105.
</p>

<p>
Used courseplay to drew a new outline for "big field", its therefore called CP-21. I did this because the poor terrain design, in the SE tip there is a spot that cannot fit multiple tools with decent width, this will be fixed eventually on the terrain but for now I am bypassing it by drawing a custom field outline, also it gives name to this field heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T19:28:00Z Started fertilizing CP-21, courseplay 3x tools.
</p>

<p>
Using 3 * 30m tools to fertilize this field is enjoyable, very doable, however... there would still be plenty of room for bigger equipment, for example to make it even number you could add fourth bredal k165 30m spreader, or go with the big boy route and maybe change to two rubicon 9000s.
</p>

<p>
In other words, I'm sitting and waiting here for 3 * 30m fertilizing field work course to finish <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T20:27:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-21.
</p>

<p>
I slept only four or so hours last night, absolutely dead tired eyes closing, so saved game and shutdown FS22, time for a nap.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T23:25:00Z Nap time is over, loading savegame back up, farming continues.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T23:28:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T23:29:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T23:34:00Z Parked vehicles to borrowed F11 farm yard, saved game and now its time for days first meal, I am starvin'...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-27T23:50:00Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm going to time accelerate until april next year which is the soybeans planting season, while doing that I'll monitor dealership used vehicles sales page and try to find good stuff. I need two more combines and planters, I don't want to plant CP-21 using only two kinze 3665 blue drives even though its much better than one, I just want four of them, or at least bare minimum of three. Also spraying equipment, either I buy two more 28m kubota tractor carried sprayers or go for the big league with rubicon 9000, not sure yet.
</p>

<p>
So lets time accelerate to march while monitoring the sales, hopefully I'll catch something but if I don't then I'll buy brand new stuff.
</p>

<p>
Dec in-game 1829hrs dealership had mack super-liner 6x4 on sale for -58% off 46.1k, had to buy that, she can pull a tanker trailer for herbicide or solid trailer for seeds. This deal came default with design 2 which is the american eagle, nice <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Jan in-game 1827hrs dealership had meridian tl 12-39 auger pipe for -62% off 5.4k, had to buy that even though I don't yet have any auger pipe operated farm bin silos.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0922hrs okay I have reached the set date, no actual essential equipment found on the dealership sales, so now its time to buy planting equipment.
</p>

<pre>
- tanker trailer 32k liters lsfm innovations utts-32000 58k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above with green color option for herbicide +1k and fendt red color option for seeds +1k. Iconik seed refill station for 7.5k and herbicide for 7.5k.
</p>

<p>
Then hooked up the UTTS-32000 seed tanker trailer to mack super-line 6x4 and refilled with seeds for 28.7k. I have never tested if LSFM UTTS-32000 in solid configuration can actually refill seeders / planters on the field, would really suck if it cannot, but I have to assume it works just fine. I know it will refill rubicon 9000 with liquid fertilizer and herbicide, so dunno why it wouldn't work for seeds as well.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 2.692m.
</p>

<p>
Next I need to decide if to go with four kinze 4905 blue drives which are the bigger kinze planters, or buy two more 3665's to supplement our existing two. I do want four planters on the field for sure, unless I would go with bourgault but nah dunno, I always do bourgault so lets now at least start with this smaller more compact method <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I quickly hopped to PMC DevSurf to search my unreleased stories pages which had some info about kinze 4905 blue drive, its tank capacity is listed as 7k liters but I remember that its the usual giants bullshit as one part of that is for liquid fertilizer, not seeds. I was disappointed in 2021 when purchased the seeder and it only took X amount of seed liters.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T00:37:00Z Unfortunately there was mentioning of it, but nothing about the seed tank capacity or rather the liquid tank capacity, guess I just grunted silently in anger and moved on, but I distinctively remember being really upset to have bought this uber cool "massive" planter and to have it some piece of shit seed tank size.
</p>

<p>
Went to FS22 game files and found fillUnit xml property with 4228 seeds and 2840 liquid fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
That is more than kinze 3665 so its an upgrade, plus its wider planter, but still it really sucks to have game luring you in with 7k capacity only to discover that its shit 4.2k only.
</p>

<p>
Downloaded <a href="https://fs22.com/farming-simulator-22-mods/implements-and-tools/seeders/kinze-4900-and-4905-blue-drive-24-row-planters-v1-0/" target="_blank">fs22.com Kinze 4900 and 4905 24 row planters v1.0 by Large H</a>.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T00:51:00Z It is really bad to start adding new mods to fix your equipment availability just when you need it, you would need to test them first, which I'm actually going to do now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game and exited to test new Large H kinze mods.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T01:04:00Z Test complete, mods are error free, added them to my PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero savegame dir and reloaded savegame, back in-game.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T01:16:00Z A bit sidetracked when penalty_box came live in twitch with Cornbelt Start From Zero of his heh, chatting with him a bit... <i>Edit: umm what, feels like some words are missing or typed wrong heh.</i>
</p>

<p>
Sold kinze 3665 for 18.3k and 98.7k. Purhcased kinze 4905 blue drive 249.5k times FOUR. Purchased new holland t8 genesis with twin wheels engine upgrade and guidancesteering 365k times TWO. Budget now 1.066m oh wow these purchases really took a bite from our budget... but then again, I am not going to sit on my hands for hours while poorly equipped planting setup is seeding soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Now I don't have money to buy TWO big combines though, those midwest durus 18.2m headers cost a fortune, oh well next harvest season will be done with three combines then, should be OK middle ground.
</p>

<p>
When kinze 4905's had been driven by CP-21 then it was time acceleration to apr soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T02:10:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-21, courseplay 4x tools.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the courseplay field work course with these four relatively narrow tools, I'm predicting there will be collisions and stopped vehicles which lead to extreme frustration. Next season I just might see two bourgault air drills in our farm ...
</p>

<p>
Oh btw these Large H edited kinze 4905 blue drive's go 21km/h which is really nice. This is realistic according to him, he set them to 13 miles per hour which is how fast they go in real life.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0214.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0214.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Once that fourth tool started, first one was already below 90% seed tank, that is not a good sign for endurace hehe. But man is the 21km/h planting speed BLAZiNG FAST! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Fendt 939 vario with 385hp pulls kinze 4905 blue drive planter (edited by Large H for realistic 21km/h speed) just fine, no horsepower issue with this tractor.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T02:36:00Z Slowly getting close to first planter seed refill moment, field is already seeded quite nicely, it might be possible to get through this field with only one refill.
</p>

<!-- PMCTODO this screenshot was extra, there was not any *fsScreen_ line for it at 0242 UTC timestamp, huh wha? -->
<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0242.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0242.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-28T02:47:00Z All kinze 4905's are empty, its refill time.
</p>

<p>
Seems like UTTS-32000 does NOT allow "overloading" seed directly to the planter with I key, sucks.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0251.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0251.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-28T02:54:00Z Done, were back to planting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
I was sceptical of how these four 4905's perform, but so far I'm actually impressed, yeah I am distracted watching penalty_box's twitch stream and chatting there, but it feels like this planting season is going really fast.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0300.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-28T0300.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And best of all, its realistic american farming. New holland T8 with kinze 4905 blue drive is familiar from youtube real life farming videos, so yeah its cool.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T03:21:00Z First tractor finished seeding CP-21 field work course. Seeds were running real low, about 200 liter left, pretty nice fit with one seed refill.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T03:23:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-21.
</p>

<p>
Parked planters into borrowed F11 farm yard along with the UTTS-32000 with seed load, then sent semi-truck to the dealership to pickup another UTTS-32000 which is used for herbicide.
</p>

<p>
Once at the dealership refilled UTTS-32000 with herbicide for 38.4k, yikes herb is expensive! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took fendt favorit 515c and hooked it up with kubota xms218 + front tank, then refilled the sprayer setup. Did same for fendt 939.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T03:56:00Z Started herbicide spraying CP-21, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
Yeah went with the existing two tools for now, just didn't ... well feel like doing the upgrade, guess I could not decide. Now I have a good herbicide refill solution so lets see how many hours it takes to spray this field with these two guys. I already did it yesterday wasnt it, so the info should be written down but its not available to me now in Gaming computer heh.
</p>

<p>
Maybe next year its time to purchase two rubicon 9000s and really rock in the spraying department.
</p>

<p>
Again I cannot see where it sprays so I have to be extremely careful with courseplay field work course. No collisions and when the tanks run dry then bring up semi-truck with the herbicide tanker trailer and fill them up. Hopefully works OK this time. Now I'm waiting until this first vehicle finishes good chunk of headland so there would not be any chance of collision.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T04:28:00Z Been googling stuff a moment, now honestly these 12km/h sprayers start to feel slow and boring, kind of like that it was a mistake to not buy two more. Oh well nothing can be do about it now, lets hang on there and we'll get through this.
</p>

<p>
There are pretty sick fertilizing contracts available, but I'm kind of lazy to start doing them. I have two bredals with tractors ready to go, all I have to do is dance through all that fertilizing contract nonsense... but yeah, not feeling it right now, some other time.
</p>

<p>
Two rubicon 9000s would probably be quite optimal for this field. They could then do both fertilizing and herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T04:38:00Z Purchased claas lexion 8900 with midest durus 18.2m header and header trailer, might as well do it now in the downtime. Budget now 323.3k wow its getting low.
</p>

<p>
Next year with soybeans profits I need to buy one more lexion 8900 and then upgrade spraying fleet. I think its going to be two rubicon 9000s, it just feels about right for this field and in the future I definitely go with rubicons.
</p>

<p>
Funny thing is... if I'd do those current fertilizing contracts... I could buy one rubicon already <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T04:44:00Z Our newest baby, claas lexion 8900 with header trailer driven and parked to borrowed F11 farm yard. Ready to go for next harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Kubota sprayer tractors on the field are getting low on the rear sprayer tank, front tanks are about to be popped to use, they are maybe 35-40% done now hard to say, so I'm thinking that maybe two of the kubota tow behind 15k liter sprayers would handle this field in one go without refilling, maybe. Three certainly would.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T04:55:00Z Now second tractors rear sprayer tank ran dry, they are now running on front tanks on both tractors.
</p>

<p>
I need to do a small chore soon so that takes a nicely this boredom away, but I have to admit to be pretty much ready to take those fertilizing contracts to pass the time and obviously make money, but now cant as there is not enough time. I just wish I can handle the sprayer refill along with my chore somehow.
</p>

<p>
Oh well, next year everything will be better, fleets for planting, spreading, spraying and harvesting are all final. It will be glorious time to do farm work, to really start big boy grinding some money.
</p>

<p>
Once I get to the point where I have two or more big farmlands that the yearly harvests get us 5+ million in cash, then I'll start purchasing everything and anything in dealership sales which I would ever imagine using, for example grass mowing equipment, perhaps even start a small forage silage bunker operation american style <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Of course the goal was to buy all the land and harvest all the fields, so should not allow too much fun "waste of time" hobby farming like doing american style silage bunkers, sure silage makes money but the real money is in massive soybeans fields.
</p>

<p>
Or who knows, wonder if you'd do lets say 2 million liters of silage, how much money would that make hmm? Err, just checked using sell price trigger mod, highest peak for silage prices is 585, err really? Well 2 million liters pays peanuts then, hoho.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T05:16:00Z Hmm back to spraying, kubota xms218 sprayer + front tank, I think three tractors with these would handle this CP-21 aka big field just sine, I'm now running 500 liters left on the lead tractor and field is maybe 70% done more or less.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T05:20:00Z Lead tractor is out of herbicide, refill time.
</p>

<p>
One thing is annoying on these front tanks... when you first refill the rear sprayer tank, then you have to turn the tractor around or drive semi-truck in front of the tractor to refill the front tank heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T05:23:00Z Lead tractor sprayers refilled, back on spraying. Now just waiting for the trailer tractor to empty out...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T05:27:00Z Trailer tractor tanks are empty. Also just realized that UTTS-32000 only has 8.5k liters left, uh oh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T05:29:00Z Refill complete, that whole 8.5k liters, trailer tractor is trailing now, and with that... I'll start my chore so these vehicles will finish before I get back...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T06:17:00Z Finished herbicide spraying CP-21. This obviously finished while I was doing a chore.
</p>

<p>
And with that, I'll go take a lunch break right away.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T06:48:00Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm excited and motivated about farming, I want to press on tonight as long my eyes keeps open and then continue tomorrow the same. This PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero will get so much progress is crazy! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I noticed that F11 is not planted, oops, my bad, will do that now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T06:54:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T06:57:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T06:58:00Z Started herbicide spraying F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Herbicide spraying right after seeding / planting is the correct way to get yield-bonus 95% regarding weeds. This needs to be written into farming-simulator.org <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T07:00:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F11.
</p>

<p>
Folded and unhooked kubota sprayer equipment wondering, is this the last time on this savegame as next year I go for rubicon 9000? (hmm well actually, hmm yeah nevermind, I still have to PLANT + HERB before I sell my crops, so no, this was not the last time heh).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T07:03:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T07:04:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T07:08:00Z Started fertilizing CP-21, courseplay 3x tools.
</p>

<p>
Bredal speaders have all different levels of product, will be going to the dealership to buy another UTTS-32000 tanker trailer with solid carrying capacity to haul some solid fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Purchased UTTS-32000 with colors for 59k, drove semi-truck there, hooked tanker trailer up, then refilled with solid fertilizer for 51.2k whoah, thats a lot. Budget now 212.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T07:36:00Z Fendt favorit 515c bredal k105 ran out of fertilizer, okay calling up the semi-truck with tanker trailer.
</p>

<p>
Solid fertilizer refilling in progress...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T08:04:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-21.
</p>

<p>
Soybeans planting season is over for this year! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now just time accelerating until harvest season while monitoring dealership sales for the little 212.1k money I have, contracts are out of the question my mind is set to break out three lexion 8900s and start harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 1841hrs soybeans market price 3802 at PMC Sell 10. Too bad I ain't got nothing to sell <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now after a long long time there is a spraying contract offering rubicon 9000 as borrowed vehicle, I have not seen that in probably couple of in-game years, very odd.
</p>

<p>
Jul in-game 0840hrs dealership has convey-all conveyall 1690 (yes thats the brand and model) auger pipe in sale for -40% off, purchased it for 15.2k.
</p>

<p>
There was also some dizzying amount of money to be made with fertilizing and harvesting contracts, if one just had the energy and willingness to do them all.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0915hrs soybeans are ready to harvest, lets get to work.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T08:23:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Personally took the virgin lexion 8900 out for a spin, gotta break her in <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T08:29:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F11. Oops forgot to timestamp this, until now, ugh.

<p>
2022-09-28T09:58:00Z Courseplay course failed in one of the lands changes, combines simply stopped and shut their engines off, go figure. Luckily I figured out which pass they were on.
</p>

<p>
Wide lane I got here.

2022-09-28T11:29:00Z Weather forecast has rain coming next, I'm on our last pass cutting soybeans and it would be SO typical if it started to rain just before finishing this pass <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T11:35:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans CP-21. Aayeah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This harvest went pretty nicely, just had one hiccup with the course, hopefully next year when I do full 4 combine harvest there wont be any hiccups like this, otherwise I have to change the starting point or something.
</p>

<p>
Once done harvesting I took the youngest combine and went to clean up few corner spots which had actually surprising amount of soybeans left. As I have close to 900k liters already these kind of missed spots, small patches, don't really change anything... but I just want to go clean them up anyways.
</p>

<p>
Combine now has 2027 liters, lets see how much after cleanup... NNNGGGH! while I was typing this sentence... fucking combine reached the furthest corner patch and of course ran over the crop <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well carefully backing up and hopefully I didn't destroy much.
</p>

<p>
That mentioned combine got 2464 liters, then I used another to cleanup other corner.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T11:55:00Z Parked semi-trucks and combines, emptied demco 2200 grain cart into farm bin silo... which got full, had to leave several thousand liters into demco 2200, well it waits here until I start to haul grain to selling point.
</p>

<p>
Then hooked tractors up with bredal spreaders, refilled solid fertilizer from semi-truck what was left (not much), then sent semi-truck to the dealership to pickup more solid fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T11:58:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Combine harvesters engines haven't even started to cool off yet and I already start preparations for next years planting season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T11:59:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
I'm in a mad rush here because its my lunch time but I want to start fertilizing CP-21 before I grab a bite to eat, save time, efficient time use baby, that's what we're all about <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T12:02:00Z Refilled UTTS-32000 tanker trailer with 32k liters of solid fertilizer for 51.2k, man that is expensive. Then sent semi back to spreaders.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T12:11:00Z Started fertilizing CP-21, courseplay 3x tools.
</p>

<p>
Just as I started these guys for the fertilizing field work course I checked dealership sales, oh noe! there are rubicon 9000 with -52% off and I don't have enough money (its 232.7k with that discount) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm its newest on sale in the list, maybe after these tractors finish fertilizing our own field I could do couple contracts to get that money and then buy it, hmm not that it would help much alone in herbicide spraying, it would actually just mess things up, hmm, yeah its a good idea and great value, but ... unfortunately, I just don't have the money right now, we'll see how I feel about it once lunch and this field is fertilized...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T12:15:00Z Okay all tractors are spreading solid fertilizer, now its my lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T12:37:00Z Feeding time is over, lets get back to fertilizing CP-21. Uuh only like 35% done now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T13:08:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-21. It actually finished while I was chatting in twitch, asking about if lode king distinction super B is realistic trailer.
</p>

<p>
Drove spreader tractors to the dealership for diesel refuel, they were getting low like 30% tank left. Also while there, topped up bredal's with fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Decided to do one big fertilizing contract to get money for that rubicon, it just bothers me if I let it go, I'd kind of want to just time accelerate and move on, but heh lets do the contract <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T13:29:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F01.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T13:30:00Z Started contract fertilizing F01, courseplay 3x tools.
</p>

<p>
Now Better Contracts mod works, previously the config file was simply not working. What happened was I downloaded the github repo as ZIP, then deleted the unused files and created another ZIP for farm sim, same as I've done thousands of times since FS17 times with courseplay etc. Well apparently the lua scripting code does not accept that "better_contracts" name and wanted "FS2_BetterContract" I believe it was, so once I renamed the zip and deleted the old modSetting XML file, it started to work, now I get unlimited number of contracts and lazy AI is also working. Haven't been doing much testing but just through normal game-play it seems to work OK. Right now I have four contracts accepted, just for a test.
</p>

<p>
As I'm having a lot of time on my hands watching these bredal spreaders doing their thing, was thinking about the future of this savegame, where does this end. The purpose of this specific savegame was to prove that I am not lame money making placeable cheater who just time accelerates to make so much money he can buy all the land and vehicles he wants. I believe that is pretty much proven by now. This savegame technically was not following the old school FS17 Cornbelt Start From Scratch rules of no coursplay or GPS before you own both land and vehicle(s) but that was only because I made a slight mistake by being too excited of my very own first vehicle that I forgot the land part of the rule heh. So yeah it was not a malice kind of rule breaking, more like enthusiasm got the better of me. So yeah if you want to be technical bitch then yup this is not following old school rules, but I would say that this is. I am very happy and satisfied with this savegames progress. <i>Edit: not sure what the fuck was I smoking saying this savegame is not cheating when it clearly is.</i>
</p>

<p>
So about the future, well dunno really, now that I get all the best equipment next year, well OK perhaps not the bourgault best but almost, so after that its just about buying more land and starting to move our farming operation from one field to the next like locusts. When you have the best equipment then money is only spent on product and buying new land. I don't exactly remember from PMC Texas Rowena 8km New Farmer savegame and PMC Grande Gardens 16km or Midwest Horizons Start From Zeros (links in <a href="../19/stories.php">FS19 Stories</a> page) that at what point do I switch to do direct drilling soybeans without any other field preparation work done like fertilizing, spraying etc.
</p>

<p>
Until all the land has been bought I think the goal still would be to make the maximum amount of money which is done by maxing out soybeans yields, which means fully fertilized and herbicide sprayed.
</p>

<p>
Currently that kind of mass spamming soybeans any means necessary is still a far in the future. On rough estimate next year I'll do first harvest with the best equipment, year after that... hmm well I think then I could start to buy more land to get even more money.
</p>

<p>
But where does this all end, am I going to play right in the end buy all the land and harvest all the fields... uuh not right now at least, meaning this week or near future. Since I already have quite nice equipment and a big land my mind has been wandering into the new project to test & upgrade all FS22 PMC Terrains into Start From Zero compatible feature set (small fields, grass fields, etc).
</p>

<p>
Right now its very interesting tempting to break out those late winter early spring 2022 created FS22 terrains and start testing which if any of them allows Start From Zero to work, then edit them to add that capability.
</p>

<p>
I'm still going to continue this savegame tomorrow at least, I have no plans of ending this specifically but also I would not want to predict my mood beyond tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
See, this is what kind of mumbling mumbo jumbo text you get when there is boring long courseplay field work running <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T14:02:00Z Starting to have some serious yawns, hmm the nap time messed things up today so looking at time is not very accurate, but I don't think my bedtime is near yet, few more hours at least.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T14:42:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F01, collected reward 354.4k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-28T14:45:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, I'm way too tired going to the full zombi mode, gotta call it a night, nites.
