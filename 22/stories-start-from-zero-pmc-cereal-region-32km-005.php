	<h2>2023-01-30 Exhausting 19 Hours Farming Session</h2>

<p>
2023-01-30T10:55:00Z New farming day has started, todays goal is to buy bigger equipment... and have fun with those <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 55hrs 30min on it.
</p>

<p>
Last night I spotted weeds on F442 wheat, oh right forgot to herbicide spray that field, my bad. Okay have to get it done now losing some yield when burning off some wheat crop but cant be helped.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:00:00Z Started herbicide spraying F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:03:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F442. Good start for a day <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:04:00Z Started fertilizing F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:08:00Z Finished fertilizing F442.
</p>

<p>
Okay now our wheat field, for seed production, has been taken care of, nothing more to do than time accelerate until its ready to harvest. Yeah I could sell off the new holland ch7.70 combine and upgrade already, but I'll count this wheat field for the current harvest season which I want to finish with small equipment before breaking out the big guns <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But then I realized by looking at the calendar that next event will be another soybeans planting season, hmph well this yearly rotation is such that equipment upgrade is next, before getting to soybeans plant another season, hmm hmm. Also after the vehicle and equipment upgrade if there are any money left, that should go to buying new land after reserving some to fertilizer / herbicide product.
</p>

<p>
Hmm while I'm contemplating what to buy, will splash layer of fertilization to existing fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:16:00Z Started fertilizing F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Gotta love fertilizing newly harvested field, its like new beginning, again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:21:00Z Finished fertilizing F454.

<p>
2023-01-30T11:27:00Z Finished fertilizing F453.

<p>
Uuuh I'm starving, but gotta finish this last fertilization before eating.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:27:00Z Started fertilizing F455, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T11:34:00Z Finished fertilizing F455.
</p>

<p>
And now its my days first meal time, so hungry! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T12:06:00Z Feeding time is over, back to building our farm.
</p>

<p>
Was googling a bit for planter, most realistic american one seems to be kinze 4905 by Large H, although not sure how many liters of seeds it takes, I'd hate to have a planter that requires 17 refills on a medium size field. It can be mitigated by throwing more planters to a single field of course, but seems rather silly way to get around that. In my PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero used ... was it actually four kinze 3660 planters on a single field, it was at least two but hmm I think I had four, anyways more than one.
</p>

<p>
But I need wheat aka seeder too, hmm so no idea which one to get, would like to get some realistic american one but dunno if there are any other than seed hawk or bourgault massive air drills heh.
</p>

<p>
Then of course its the combine choice, hmm what to get. I feel like these questions should have been researched and answered away from active savegame situation because I feel so "pressured" to make a decision now that I fear it might be a poor one... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I think any seeder and combine I get will be a mod solution, I've been playing enough with the giants in-game stuff and sure there are options but I feel like now its time for better ones.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T12:13:00Z Sold new holland ch7.70 combine harvester and its header, I don't need it anymore. Budget now 1.782m.
</p>

<p>
Real life day for me today is a long one, it just got started with morning meal, so I could... maybe... even do one 216ha field fertilizing contract which would make me a nice 400k, but I don't think that would make any difference as with current budget I can buy pretty much any seeder and combine, even some crazy bourgault and lexion 8900 would still fit into my budget hmm. Oh and not to mention that before needing to buy harvester, I get to sell 216.8k liters of soybeans, in quick calculation it could be 216 * 3800 == 820.8k hmm am I calculating that correctly now, geez thats huge amount of money.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, money is not an issue, all I have to do is sit back, put my feet up and buy whatever I need <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T12:18:00Z Checked the dealership sales and hoh there was kinze 3660 blue drive (large h edited) for -67% off.
</p>

<p>
Large H edited kinze planter4900.xml has fillTypes="seeds" capacity="4228" and fillTypes="liquidFertilizer" capacity="2840", hmm 4.2k liters of seeds, wonder how long it will last on that wide and fast planter. planter4905.xml has the exact same capacity. Then planter3660.xml has fillTypes="seeds" capacity="3876" so its slightly smaller capacity, not a big difference and this 3665 is what I believe much smaller planter so relatively speaking that 3.8k would last much longer.
</p>

<p>
Of course kinze 3660 planter only plants: corn, sunflowers, soybeans, sugarbeets and cotton. Its quite limited collection of stuff, pure american farming stuff "corn & soybeans".
</p>

<p>
Hmm with my current mod-set, the only realistic american big seeder / planter which could do soybeans and wheat is bourgault, that would require a very powerful tractor to pull it. I am not sure if there are any mods out there which would be slightly smaller size but still do the same task I need. Or do I need to buy smaller wheat / barley / oat seeder and big planters for corn / soybeans, hmm hmm. In a way it would be cheaper just to buy regular MEGA bourgault drill for seed cleaner source crops (wheat, etc) and money crops (soybeans). I am not planning on doing realistic american corn now, its never been a good money making crop its more like american realism and simply wanting to do it, corn yields insane amounts but pays very little per 1000 liters so its a huge workload to get it done if you want to make money. Don't get me wrong, I love american farming and corn, but when you need money...
</p>

<p>
As a side note, I kind of would like to add crop rotation mod in to give some spice to this savegame, but dunno it goes into realism game-play too much which limits money making capabilities <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm I decided not to buy that kinze 3660 from sale, its too small for what I need, if it would plant wheat or other seed cleaner accepted crops yeah them maybe, but no, I need bigger stuff, I don't have time to fool around.
</p>

<p>
Decided another thing which I mentioned before; now its not the time to start googling equipment options, I have to use what I have loaded into this savegame right now, there is a time and a place to browse new mods, now is not that time. So yeah what can I say, bourgault air drill it is, only question is should I get the smaller one first or go right to the big boy 3420-100 hmm, I kind of don't like the big one as its such a lame slug when traveling on the road, hmm.

<p>
Now I'm ready for soybeans planting season, hopefully got enough seeds, didn't want to buy a lot because soon we'll get that GtX seed cleaner to operate and then we never buy seeds again.
</p>

<p>
Boys are ready.

It is hilarious what kind of difference a mega monster seeding equipment makes compared to that medium size 9m kverneland I used before <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2023-01-30T13:56:00Z Oh noe, ran out of seeds on second to last pass! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership, purchased two big bags of seeds, refilled bourgault 71300 air cart with 2k liters of seeds. This will be enough.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T14:01:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F455.

<p>
Parked bourgault air drill and saved game, seeding is done.

<p>
2023-01-30T14:04:00Z Started herbicide spraying F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Don't think we need anymore screenshots from these field works as its already been shown, its now just the same routine on different year.
</p>

<p>
So, what a difference is that between kverneland 9m planter and bourgault 3420-100 air drill 30.6m, just crazy, it took me about ONE HOUR to plant soybeans with 9m implement and it took me LESS than one hour to plant THREE (3) fields with bourgault! A big difference of gaming time usage. What I concluded yesterday that better vehicles and equipment is higher priority than just more land to farm. With big equipment you can spam more soybeans harvests within gaming day.

</p>

<p>
While fertilizing this field was thinking about combine harvester purchase, I could go with the traditional claas lexion 8900 with midwest durus header, actually I don't have the money for that currently, eiher would have to sell soybeans cheap or do a fertilizing contract. Hmm nevermind, money is not an issue, my next harvest is wheat on jul and that is the next morning from best market price for soybeans, which I'm going to sell on that day, so when harvest comes I have hundreds of thousands of cash again.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T14:29:00Z Finished fertilizing F454. And now restroom break while game is saving...

That is it, planting season is a wrap! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Did another savegame now that planting season is over, just in case. Cant afford to lose any progress.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0912hrs today is soybeans best market price day, it happens at night time close to midnight, or rather shall I say the price increases until 2359hrs when it starts to drop again, it reaches it peak at 2359hrs, which is kind of silly that unless you have 10 grain trailers already sitting at the selling point ready to unload, you are in any case missing A LITTLE bit of money as you cannot sell all your grain at once. But yeah, price does not fall that fast, just saying, you know.
</p>

<p>
Luckily this time I have autodrive network setup so all I have to do is to send my semi-truck selling even in the pitch black darkness.
</p>

<p>
Was going to restart fs22 to add a bigger harvester mod and another game-play mod, but decided against it on the last minute, I'll just get my good old workhorse claas lexion 8900 and midwest durus 18.2m header, its rock solid setup and requires no new fancy mods (ok header is a mod but its well battle proven).
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 1637hrs my sell price trigger alerted for soybeans being above 3770 price. At in-game 1705hrs its 3782.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T15:31:00Z First load sold for 2 * 77.3k, budget now 660k. Forgot to write down happenings, market price peaked at 3809 when I was waiting for magical 3810 limit but it never came, as I'm typing this in-game 2234hrs price is 3802 at big barn grain selling point where I'm hauling now.
</p>

<p>
Also edited autodrive network a bit as I have plenty of time on these 21min one way trips to that selling point haha. Created autodrive network directories for selling points, fields 100-200 etc.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T15:46:00Z Hmm these 21min one way semi-truck grain hauling trips are quite brutal heh, I should just buy more trucks... but actually right now I need to be careful because combine harvester and header purchase already takes roughly 500k + 180k or something like that, its not cheap to have lexion 8900s. So need to be patient. Actually I'm not sure whats the future of this savegame, I now buy the harvester and finish harvest season, then what? Well seed cleaner goes active, do I have any money to buy new land after that, don't know? Hmm, would I begin another planting season after the harvest today... do I have enough time, hmm actually yeah as I'm still on my first meal so yes there is plenty of time relatively speaking. But indeed what is the future for this savegame, do I play this tomorrow... I don't think so, have to come up with something else to do, most likely editing as I've again got myself a nice dose of farming for a while, few days at least heh. So, patience to ride along with semi-truck hauling soybeans to sell at big barn grain...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T15:55:00Z Semi-truck sold 40.7k load, 2 * 77.3k, budget now 814.6k.
</p>

<pre>
- header 18.2m midwest durus with pointed guides and color options 176.9k
- harvester 18k liters claas lexion 8900 configuration big and guidancesteering upgrade 511.3k

688.2k
</pre>

<p>
2023-01-30T15:58:00Z Purchased above list now that I just barely got the money for it while semi-truck is hauling grain to sell. Budget now 134.4k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright, we are set for big boy grain farming, well at least the bare minimum <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm, I'm going to purchase another semi-truck and grain trailer, at the moment there is still 135.4k liters to haul which just from top of my head makes 3 trips so 3 * 21min (one way)... yeah heh I don't even need to calculate all that together, I'll buy second semi after this next load is hauled, I already have made plans...
</p>

<p>
Of course these grain hauling times are nothing new, dude is playing on 32.7km x 32.7km terrain, what did you expect to get on such monster size, some 3-5min hops to nearest selling point, huh? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh I checked contracts as well while waiting but there was now fertilizing available, might have been way to pass the time and make some extra money. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
<i>Just shut the fuck up and wait!</i> -Denzel Washington, Training Day.
</p>

<p>
I do look forward to finishing harvest season and that time could estimate if there is enough budget to buy another piece of farmland to expand my farming operation a bit. Just need to be careful not to over extend myself, don't want to get caught pants down with no money when planting season begins and need to buy fertilizer etc product.
</p>

<p>
Of course budget can be easily fixed with fertilizing contracts, our fertilizing fleet is... well its simply awesome, 4 * bredal k165 with extensions and 2 * rubicon 9000 with refill tanker trailer, that is a license to print money.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T16:21:00Z Semi-truck sold grain trailer load for 2 * 77.2k, budget now 288.8k.
</p>

<pre>
- trailer 75.6k liters lode king distinction super-b 138.5k
- truck 500hp 80km/h mack super-liner 6x4 110k
===
248.5k
</pre>

<p>
2023-01-30T16:23:00Z Purchased the above, now we split grain hauling time in half. Budget now 38.3k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Put semi-truck with lode king distinction super-b into autodrive grain hauling route, unfortunately on the first load it did not refill the rear hopper, I had to stop it and do it myself, then it was hauling full 75.6k liter load. Now only 19.1k liters left in the grain bin silo, almost not worth to drive to the big barn grain selling point, but hmm dunno, yeah it doesn't really change anything logistics wise so yeah I'll leave that to next time I'm selling grain.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T16:34:00Z Oops, was thinking about future farm growing plans and wilson pacesetter loaded that 19.1k liters of soybeans from bin silo, so I just clicked autodrive proceed to the next target point, ok its another 18min over there, then technically I could already shut the semi-truck down and time accelerate to wheat harvest season and while harvesting, this semi-truck could return back to home plate again. I just would want to avoid further time use for this grain hauling.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T16:41:00Z Semi-truck with super-b dumped to big barn grain, budget now 325k. The semi-truck got stuck because autodrive target point was too close, super-b did not get into the trigger, or something. Anyways I fixed it with a new target point, should work now.
</p>

<p>
Hmm 325k thats pretty decent money, might be even able to buy new farmland, small one. Or maybe two, hmm those small ones I recently created to this terrain are somewhere around the 100k mark.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 2346hrs soybeans market price had already dropped to 3790, it drops fast...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T16:47:00Z Semi-truck with wilson pacesetter sold its load, budget now 397.6k, cool. Had to do some autodrive work here as well, but it was partly my fault, I deleted the target point where this semi-truck was going so it got confused when it reached... nothing. Anyways fixed, grain sold, semi-truck heading back to the home plate, we are done here.
</p>

<p>
And with that, its my lunch break, yeehaaw I'm starvin'...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T17:15:00Z Feeding time is over, back to farming. Now I'm excited for the wheat harvest season, then setting up GtX seed cleaner and after that soybeans harvest season, then finally to see if we can buy more land for the next season, cant wait to get it going.
</p>

<p>
Jul in-game 0533hrs wheat was ready to harvest already at in-game midnight 0019hrs, but now in the daylight its much nicer to harvest.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T17:20:00Z Started harvesting wheat F442, manually GPS.

2023-01-30T17:35:00Z Finished harvesting wheat F442. Okay now our seed cleaner source material has been harvested, good stuff. Total liters is 44.6k which is fine, but once I start to expand this operation then these southern long fields will probably become a seed cleaner source fields just to keep the seed producing running 24/7. I'm not sure but the input grain should turn into seeds 1:1 ratio, lumigen treatment is just the thing thats put there, so right now I'm looking at 44k liters of seeds, sure that is more than fine for these current fields but as said once farmland expands... seeds are going out at ever faster rate when bourgault hits the big fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T17:41:00Z Purchased GtX Seed Cleaner for 67k, placed it on F442 N which is our "farm yard" heh, poor little PMC Cereal Region 32km as there is not even room for farm yards <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<pre>
- trailer 9k strautmann sek 802 pallet autoloader configuration pallets extreme 9k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above and 3 tanks of lumigen seed treatment agent. Then hooked strautmann up to kubota m8-201 and hauled the lumigen agents to seed cleaner. Next took semi-truck with wilson pacesetter, loaded first hopper full of wheat 20k some liters and dumped into seed cleaner. Finally strautmann autoloading trailer unloaded lumigen tanks into seed cleaner area.
</p>

<p>
We are making seeds! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Went to visit the head, came back and already 13k liters of seed was done, wow that thing is FAST <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to check out some more farmland prices, again ID is HECTARES for THOUSANDS, style. 44 is 8.6ha for 82.2k, 40 is 17.8ha for 169.9k, 45 is 22.6ha for 215.4k, 47 is 10ha for 95.5k and 51 is 17.4ha for 165.6k. There is plenty of nice small compact fields which would fit my equipment well and eventually would start to generate decent yields.
</p>

<p>
Seed cleaner was running low on wheat so topped it up. At this time it already had 26k liters of seeds, whoah <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0945hrs soybeans harvest season is here, at the time of writing thi...s hehe, soybeans JUST switched into ready to harvest stage <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T18:19:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T1819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T1819.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Yeah decided to do this harvest season manually driving with GPS, but in the future I'll switch to courseplay use so I can get my hands free and do other things, maybe contracts while my own combine is running, dunno. And I love GPS driving, so <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
While driving in-cab with GPS got to do a lot of thinking, best farming / terrain ideas come like this heh. About grain carts, this harvest goes nicely me driving but next one will be courseplay, I'm not sure if semi-truck and wilson pacesetter is a proper unloading setup for autodrive driving, so would have to get grain cart. Maybe put kubota m8-201 to pull kinze 851 auger wagon, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T18:53:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F454.
</p>

<p>
But before starting the next field, quick visit to the head. This is one of the downsides of GPS that you cant go hands free completely like with courseplay, unless its some exceptionally large field with huge passes <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T19:00:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F453, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Just cutting some soybeans.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T19:30:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F453.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T19:32:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F455, manually GPS. One more field GPS driving and on the next season I'll do courseplay operations.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T19:58:00Z Hmm interesting, now I get to feel like yeah this ain't no ravenport garden patch set of fields that I have spent good time harvesting here. Still not bored or anything worse, having a good time, but yes I now notice how much time has passed (no idea of actual minutes but still haha).
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T20:10:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F455. That is it, harvest season is done! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
In this time I spent harvesting seed cleaner has gotten full 80k liters of seeds, it still had few thousand liters of wheat left so it was pretty nicely matched. Actually, hmm thats surprising, I only had... how many thousand liters of wheat and now I got 80k liters of seeds, doesn't that mean there is huge maybe 2 * increase on the wheat:seed ratio? Hmm interesting and kind of... bummed out, I mean the GRAIN is the thing that becomes a seed, where does the seed grainy thing come from if there is not enough wheat grain, hehe, so yeah dunno. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
I took a 189 liters of seeds to wilson pacesetter as a test, went to unia farma-whatever grain bin silo and as I expected "Seeds not accepted here" error came to the screen, so yeah we are not storing seeds in here then. Hmm giants default placeables had those meridian bins and I believe they accept seeds or are actually even meant to be used in such manner, but they require auger pipe to load and unload which I kinda hate, well not kinda but I do, you cant use those with autodrive.
</p>

<p>
Well I think we can go long way just by loading bourgault 71300 air cart directly from GtX seed cleaner too, that 80k liters will last us a long long time with these fields.
</p>

<p>
Still at oct in-game 1203hrs, now its wheat planting season, so guess I'll go seed some wheat then, or maybe I'll quickly research what crop gets the most yield, I believe its wheat but need to check <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm so looks like BARLEY has the best yield, I googled it and checked my own FS19 notes and its 0.96 liters per square meter (or something, anyways its 9.6k liters per hectare), this is MUCH more than wheat which is behind corn as third best yield. Corn is obviously not a good choice because planting and harvesting equipment, its only good if you want to be realistic american farmer.
</p>

<p>
So now I'm definitely switching seed cleaner source crop type to barley.
</p>

<p>
Took semi-truck with wilson pacesetter, loaded first hopper full of seeds from seed cleaner, then drove it to bourgault 71300 air cart and used it "loading spoon" to refill hopper full. Now it should be good to go for some barley seeding.
</p>

<p>
But first I'm going to lay down one layer of fertilizer on all fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T20:51:00Z Started fertilizing F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T20:53:00Z Finished fertilizing F442. Yup manually done, but one thing about small fields and large vehicles is that... courseplay does not do very good job with them, or if it does... then its definitely slower than human being driving with GPS, well, at least I drive fast, not that its a race but yeah heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T20:55:00Z Started fertilizing F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Again no screenshots, take a look at ones earlier from today, they are the same only clock has different digits on top-right corner <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Also I'm trying to reduce video capturing footage for the exact same reason, but I still take quick few seconds snippets. While fertilizing with rubicon I'm thinking... wonder if changing to barley and making all these southern fields source for seed cleaner is overkill, maybe F442 already is producing enough source grain that accumulative effect over years is that unless I buy crazy amounts of fields it would be enough to keep us supplied with seeds, especially if it now looks like seed cleaner does 1:2 ratio from grain to seed (I think?). Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Maybe if I'll turn F454 into barley and purchase new fields for soybeans, hmm hmm. Then at least the barley crop would be definitely enough to keep the farm supplied with seeds.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:00:00Z Finished fertilizing F454.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:00:00Z Started fertilizing F453, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:13:00Z Finished fertilizing F455.
</p>

<p>
Okay another save game and restroom break while I contemplate what is my next step... Well, I want to buy more land, nothing crazy not to stretch out my single bourgault and lexion 8900, but just enough to increase soybeans production especially as at least F454 goes to barley seed production now. I would like to put bourgault and lexion 8900 under courseplay when I go do fertilizing contracts, hopefully that would not turn into a time sink of its own heh.
</p>

<p>
Purchased farmland IDs; 44 is 8.6ha for 82.2k, 40 is 17.8ha for 169.9k, budget now 57.3k, yikes! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
New fields in these lands are F452 and F449.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:33:00Z Finished fertilizing F449.

<p>
2023-01-30T21:45:00Z Finished seeding barley F442. That was fast <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:46:00Z Started seeding barley F454, manually GPS. I'm kind of scared how much F454 yields in barley, combine has to unload so many times heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T21:54:00Z Finished seeding barley F454. Source crop for seed cleaner has now been seeded, next year we are going to get so much raw material for that use oh my.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T22:00:00Z Started herbicide spraying F442, manually GPS. Yes still GPS driving because rubicon is just way too big for this small field using courseplay.

<p>
2023-01-30T22:13:00Z Started fertilizing F442, courseplay, ETA 6min.
</p>

<p>
Good to have bredals back in the fields, even though F442 is ridiculously small but at least it leaves me hands free, I've done my share of GPS driving yesterday and today <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Earlier I mentioned field sizes that they are close to 10ha, well the FARMLAND area is that, field itself is much smaller, for example F454 additional field info is reading field definition which is more or less at the actual field size... and shows 6.27ha as size, that is far cry from ten hectares Its difficult to say to a decimal point what size the field cultivator_density is what I'm farming now.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T22:20:00Z Finished fertilizing F442. As strange as it sounds, F442 was not exactly too small for courseplay.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T22:25:00Z Finished fertilizing F454. Barley planting season is over. Now we wait <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
And now its lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T23:00:00Z Feeding time is over, last section of today begins, lets make good use of it, I want to harvest soybeans one more time, do I have time, hmm, time will tell, err, what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0837hrs soybeans planting season has arrived, lets get to work. I am now going to run bourgault using courseplay and then see if I can "quickly" go do some fertilizing contracts nearby.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T23:08:00Z Started seeding soybeans F453, courseplay, ETA 12min. Had a slight courseplay configuration problems and thank goodness game informed me that this crop cant be planted in april as I still had barley selected <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Field work 12min, plus whatever courseplay takes turning that big air drill, it doesn't leave much time for me to do anything else, certainly not any fertilizing contracts on large fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T23:18:00Z While bourgault and courseplay was working, I wrote copy-paste list for seeding, herbicide spraying and fertilizing these soybean fields. Now all I have to do is to follow my copy-paste master list orders. Life is so easy, if you make it so <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T23:22:00Z Started seeding soybeans F452, courseplay, ETA 22min. Well this was a bit longer, still not "long" duration yet, not even half an hour.
</p>

<p>
There is F219 spraying contract, but uh its 216ha field so will take a long time and might need a refill for two rubicons, but it would be good money, I'm just not comfortable of taking that big of a contract because my own fields wont generate long enough field work courses. But I'll put rubicons spraying the fields I've already seeded.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Saved game, we are all done with soybeans AND barley planting season. Feeling good, cannot wait to get into harvest season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Barley harvest season begins jun, that is also at 2359hrs or well late in the day, soybeans best market price, so semi-trucks must run a bit.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0551hrs after time accelerating 5000 speed barley is still growing 5/6 field stage. Need to wait a bit to game to catch up, gotta love playing in huge 32km terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm a bit later it changed to growth stage "6/6 (forage)", hmm so guess I have to time accelerate another day/month which also is the last day/month to harvest barley. I'm going to give few more minutes time to game to sync, just incase the next stage is still coming today.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 1817hrs sell price trigger alerted that soybeans are 3812 on west foods limited, this selling point is at due west from the dealership by F173 SE corner. Alright time to send semi-trucks to haul our 193.5k liters of soybeans. Lets make some money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
While semi-trucks were rolling towards west foods limited soybeans market price had increased to 3813. Gimme all your money! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 44.7k, hopefully we make some good money from this 193k harvest.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T01:22:00Z First semi-truck wilson pacesetter reached west foods limited selling point, sold 2 * 77.6k worth of soybeans, had a autodrive network waypoint target problem, had to delete it, create new one and setup this "new route".
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T01:27:00Z Second semi-truck super-b reached, dumped 75.6k(?) liters, budget now 488.4k, whoah it increased quickly <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now farm grain bin silo has 77.2k left so its not two full truck loads, but I'll run the bin silo empty anyways.
</p>

<p>
Small statistics, for 200k liters grain haul, two wilson pacesetters are enough, one is a bit slim but with two it wont take long to get done, especially if trailers are lode king distinction super-b.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T01:42:00Z Wilson pacesetter sold 2 * 77.7k. Seven seven seven, gimmeh all yah moneyz <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T01:45:00Z Super-b sold its load, budget now 783.4k.
</p>

<p>
Next up is time accelerating until barley is ready to harvest. Jul in-game 0914hrs and then waiting for field stage to change. Finally it changed and its harvest time.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T02:06:00Z Started harvesting barley F442, courseplay, ETA 15min.
</p>

<p>
Was emptying harvester using semi-truck wilson pacesetter. Dumped one wilson pacesetter hopper load into seed cleaner, its back on business.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T02:19:00Z Finished harvesting barley F442. Barley yielded quite nicely, had the gut feeling that its a lot, much more than wheat thats for sure.

<p>
This field has no objects surrounding it so I generated courseplay field work course without headland but still using "lands", it works OK but feels somehow weird how the harvester is turning on the ends, maybe I'll continue doing headlands even though there is no need objects wise.
</p>

<p>
Oh and driving a semi-truck into the field to unload a harvester feels very unnatural, yes I know Welker Farms are doing it as they don't have a grain cart but still, I really need to buy some sort of auger wagon to help.
</p>

2023-01-31T03:01:00Z Finished harvesting barley F454. Oops forgot to timestamp this, don't believe what it says harvest finished like 10min ago hehe. Now farm grain bin silo has 152.1k liters of barley and seed cleaner has about 23k liters, oh my. Oh and seed cleaner is again full 80k liters of seeds, I need to figure out a tool pipeline from seed maker to some seed storage, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Alright lets keep the show rolling, time accelerating until soybeans harvest season in oct.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0759hrs soybeans harvest season has begun, the usual wait after time acceleration for fs22 to catch up with 32km terrain data heh.
</p>

<p>
Was watching penalty_box twitch live stream for a... well what felt like a long time after time accelerating and it took all that time for soybeans to get ready to harvest stage, crazy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T03:26:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F453, courseplay, ETA 26min. Courseplay field work course is now with headland, just so it feels normal again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T03:30:00Z Purchased kinze 851 grain cart for... err forgot to check, well its on video capture <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>

<p>
VehicleExplorer shows my kubota m8-201 is 193 horsepower, kinze 851 grain cart requires 240hp, but so far... this kubota has pulled it just fine on this level field. Its a nice little grain cart, so far have kept up just fine with perfect soybeans crop. Actually have to wait a long time for combine to fill up, hence writing this story hehe.
</p>

<p>
Alarm went off that I've been up 17hrs, not feeling tired at all, in fact was hungry thinking about grabbing a bite to eat heh. Will continue cautiously and be ready for sleep at moments notice. Would be cool to finish this harvest though.
</p>

2023-01-31T03:51:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F453.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T03:53:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F452, courseplay, ETA 1hrs 5min. Oh one hour field work, yikes, hum hopefully I can stay up and sharp through this field at least <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Headland in progress.
</p>

<p>
Harvester did useless victory loop, I saw it on the course before but just let it go. Problem with 32km terrain size is that PDA mapview is so low resolution that you cannot see any details from the courseplay tab gui menu whatever it is called.
</p>

<p>
F452 is biggest I own right now, then there is still F449 and F455, would be really nice to get this harvest season finished tonight before I fall asleep, but dunno man, its a lot to harvest... but I'll try my best because honestly I do not want to launch this savegame again tomorrow morning, I need to catch up on all editing stuff, forums etc, its been two days non-stop now in PMC Cereal Region 32km Start From Zero, tomorrow I gotta stop, heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T04:17:00Z Okay first good yawn came out.
</p>

<p>
Almost done.

<p>
Still staying awake, going to go after F455 right away, hopefully can stay awake...

<p>
2023-01-31T04:53:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F455, courseplay, ETA 38min.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T05:26:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F455.

<p>
2023-01-31T05:28:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F449, courseplay, ETA 33min. Last field, I can do it! Still not snoozing off to sleep! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T05:56:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F449.
</p>

<p>
Uah.
</p>

<p>
I am in half zombi mode, having a good mood but I feel exhausted for all day playing, as said 17hrs been awake alarm went off a long time ago, over 2 hours ago, fs22 stats for this session show now I've played 19hrs and 1min hehe. But yeah feeling exhausted, in theory I could still go on but it would not be enjoyable not to mention for what, what is there to do in the farm that would make any difference, it would be a new planting season which is HOURS of work again.
</p>

<p>
So yeah I'm off to sleep, going to call it a night right here. But first stats, farm grain bin silo has barley 152.1k liters and soybeans 309.5k liters oh my. And budget is 712.2k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-31T06:07:00Z Saved game and shutdown fs22. Was supposed to copy autodrive xml configs but man tiredness hits so bad I'm too scared to start copying those I might make a mistake and lose all the work, so nope. Its time to sleep, nites.
