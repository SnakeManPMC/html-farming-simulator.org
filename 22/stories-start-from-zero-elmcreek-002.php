	<h2>2022-04-22 Fertilizing Contracts</h2>

<p>
2022-04-22T12:42:37Z What can I say, burnt out and bored beyond belief and only thing which seems to interest me at the moment, is some casual small scale farming without stress or pressure. So decided to "restore" my elmcreek start from zero where I can get 60FPS solid and, well dunno what else.
</p>

<p>
So I started brand new farm manager game mode, instead of editing farms.xml I simply used dev console gsMoneyAdd to setup the same 140.1k money as I had when I deleted my previous savegame.
</p>

<p>
Now, lets farm and chill <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T12:49:57Z Accepted contract to fertilize F77 for 3k, heh ridiculous amount but I wanted to check out slurry spreader (will cheat add slurry there as where would I buy it here).
</p>

<p>
As I expected, did two passes and that joskin liquid manure tank was empty haha.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T12:57:53Z Finished this liquid manure experiment hehe. Accepted reward of whopping 3k (2.6k after lease reduction) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Accepted contract fertilizing F10 with borrowed vehicles for 13.3k, F70 for 18.8k. Then accepted all the rest which were quite low paying but lets roll through elmcreek and do them all.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 7k liters of solid fertilizer for 10.9k, budget now 129.9k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:04:04Z Started fertilizing F55.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:05:23Z Finished fertilizing F55. Hah that was quick, one pass per direction <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm so F10 is the one where I leased these vehicles, so I can accept all other contracts right away, so I did with F55, budget now 132.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:08:18Z Started fertilizing F48.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:09:11Z Finished fertilizing F48, collected contract reward 1.4k.
</p>

<p>
Hmm you know what, it takes me more time to frigging write these Start From Zero story lines of text per contract than just doing them like a dog in heat, so I'm going to skip them and only write a oneliner summary if I have the time on some long pass.
</p>

<p>
Finished F48, got some peanuts. F70 gave me 18.1k F67 was funny one 10 sec pass and done haha. F60 was equally 30sec job. F81 was so fast I didn't even have to take my finger off the B button to turn fertilizer spreader on/off heh. Hmm wonder why I took all these hundreds paying contracts, its just waste of time to drive to the field and back.
</p>

<p>
F75 was another small one. F72 was one pass per direction and then small touchup.
</p>

<p>
Bought four more solid fertilizer bags. F04 was ridiculously small, one pass and done. Then was only the last leased vehicle field left, F10.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:46:33Z Finished fertilizing contract F10, now just need to drive back to the dealership, unload 5k liters of fertilizer and collect the contract reward which returns the borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T13:48:54Z Collected reward, budget now 173.8k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T14:06:47Z Took a quick break here, now back at it. Lets start to scan new contracts.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T14:09:34Z Accepted harvest contract for F39 with borrowed vehicles for 13.7k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T14:12:40Z Started harvesting canola F39, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T14:38:24Z Delivered first trailer load of canola to the selling point. Said 42% transported.
</p>

<p>
Then I was really bored again, just had no feeling, no passion to farm, it honestly felt just stupid to harvest this canola field.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T14:59:04Z Second load dumped. Said 84% transported.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T15:01:43Z Finished harvesting canola F39.
</p>

<p>
Collected contract reward, budget now 194.2k.
</p>

<p>
And I am bored. I'm simply so frigging burnt out and bored for my terrain addon editing and arma3/fs19/fs22 playing life that its a miracle if I can pull off 17hrs productive day being it editing or playing.
</p>

<p>
I'm off for a lunch and will shutdown PMC Gaming for a day, now I feel like just reading Ukraine war news and try to get some ArmA 3 editing going on but I doubt anything comes out of that, I certainly wont continue fs22 playing. Also I wont be saying this is it for this savegame as most likely another burnout day hits and I'm back here playing again. Hah.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-22T15:06:19Z Saved game and exited fs22.
</p>

<p>
Also copied savegame dir to PMC DevSurf for safety, just in case I decide to install another Linux distribution into this M.2 NVMe where win10 + fs22 is currently installed.
