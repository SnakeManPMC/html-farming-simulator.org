<p>
A very bad big map, with big square fields <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This terrain is not meant for playing as its a simply testing version for 10.2km x 10.2km terrain size. However I was asked to share example files to test some things, so I uploaded this terrain and thought why not share with everyone. A week or so later I edited some more and added bunch of new features like rolling hills heightmap, grass, terrain detail textures for roads, three Meridian flat bottom 3608 grain bins and a vehicle shop building. So technically this is now more or less a normal terrain.
</p>

<p>
This terrain has no trees and no selling points. There are many square fields all the same size, these fields are painted in cultivator_density and there are no field definitions so contracts will not work.
</p>

<p>
Vehicle shop has no vehicle repair trigger. Farmland image is one ID covers all style.

For installing please read <a href="../19/install-mods.php">how to install FS19 mods</a> and <a href="../19/install-pmc-terrain-mods.php">how to install PMC terrain mods</a>. Yes these FS19 tutorials still work with FS22 with the obvious "19" versus "22" changes.
