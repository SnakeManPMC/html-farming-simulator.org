This above list of stuff allows you to kickstart your farm without any frustration because you are missing some essential item, you have all basic crop farming aspects covered here. Its now up to you if you can take the these vehicles plus 100,000 of money and conquer the whole terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

</div>

<p>
That list was field definition size in hectares, the actual 3D in-game fields are only slightly larger because cultivator_density has been painted accurately to real world data specifications and field definitions are made with detailed corner pieces.
</p>

<p>
Only few fields have field definitions (numbers, AI planting and contracts) to get players started, then it is up to the player to purchase land and farm the actual fields. This is by design, its not a bug, its not lazyness, we wanted it this way. There are plenty enough contracts to do and its challenging and fun to actually farm your own fields instead making money out of contracts when every field offers them.
</p>

	<h2>Placeable Objects</h2>

<p>
When you start a savegame and not own any land with placeables, nothing shows up in ESC mapview or minimap, once you buy the land with placeables, objects like buildings appear in mapview and then you get to use them, including selling them all if you do not like their placement. No more hardcoded farm yards! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_cool.gif" alt="Smiley :cool:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Placeable objects appear in farm yards. These building objects are for example vehicle sheds, grain bin silos, fertilizer tanks (liquid/solid), diesel fuel tank, water tank etc.
</p>

<p>
Land purchase areas are detailed so that you can buy small and cheap farm yards areas. No need to save money for big huge millions costing land area if you only want to get the cool farm yard with buildings on it.
</p>

<p>
Terrain includes new farmer game-mode placeables and then sixteen (16) AI owned farm yards with buildings you can use or sell after buying the land.
</p>

	<h2>Game-play</h2>

<p>
Selling points: total of 12 selling points are distributed around the terrain. Selling points accept all grains and production chain products. Special animal dealer bale selling point is located by the vehicle shop area.
</p>

<p>
Contracts: AI does planting on numbered fields, contracts are available. Plenty of money to be made on these contract fields which sizes span from small to large.
</p>

<p>
Remaining fields are just painted cultivator_density without field number or rest of the field definition. Courseplay will function on these un-numbered fields.
</p>

<p>
Farm Manager and Start From Scratch game-modes include the AI owned farm yards with buildings, once you buy the land you own the buildings with ability to sell them all, same as in New Farmer game-mode where player owns one farm yard by default.
</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This terrain was initially created in 2022-01-13 as "PMC Test Farm 20km" project name just to see if I can get 20.4km x 20.4km terrain size in-game and working. There was some issues in the beginning before I managed to get them resolved.
</p>

<p>
A brand new GIMP painted design doc was created and implemented into this terrain.
</p>

<p>
Spent a lot of time and effort to edit new features and game-play content into this terrain with the latest knowledge gained up to that point. This project at v0.1 release was very playable and even looked nice in the simplistic way with big irregular shape fields, big american vehicle sheds and grain bins etc on the several farm yards included in this terrain.
</p>

<p>
In short there was no specific plan to create a 20.4km terrain and release it... that just sort of happened on its own <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>
PMC Undefined Farms 20km terrain has basic buildings, utility poles and trees placed. Basic object placement is complete, more tweaks follow after game-play testing has produced results. If you find bugs, missing features or other issues of any kind, please send feedback so we can investigate.
</p>

<p>
Player feedback is very important to us, please feel free to share any feedback you think of while farming on this terrain.
