	<h2>Medium</h2>

Medium vehicle fleet is something you would upgrade to or perhaps buy with farm-manager type game-mode, perhaps. These vehicles are smallest / cheapest possible but still enjoyable and powerful enough to get the job done within reasonable time.

	<h2>Expensive</h2>

<p>
Now this is where we start to have some fun and do large scale farming with biggest, most powerful and widest vehicles possible.

<p>
When you got to do big boy large scale farming you absolutely should get some mods which increase your farming capability big time.

<p>
Do yourself a favor and download mods (once they are released hehe). Then various free user made mods for plows, tractors, trucks, trailers etc you name it. With mods possibilities are endless.
