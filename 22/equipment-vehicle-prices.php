<p>
Do yourself a favor and download <a href="mods.php">addons / mods</a>. There are various free user made mods for plows, tractors, trucks, trailers etc you name it. With mods possibilities are endless.
</p>

<p>
Most useful mod equipment on the expensive list would definitely be Midwest Durus 60ft combine header, then perhaps a proper american plow / ripper / field cultivator, also several higher grain tank capacity combines with american configuration has been released. So many options.
