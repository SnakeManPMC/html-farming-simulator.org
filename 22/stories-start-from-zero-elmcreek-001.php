	<h2>2022-04-20 Getting Started</h2>

<p>
2022-04-20T12:47:48Z I don't know what I'm doing, after finishing <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/terrain.php" target="_blank">ArmA 3 Ukraine etc terrain</a> releases I feel SO exhausted and burnt out, I want to get rid of this feeling and maybe relaxing farm sim might do it...
</p>

<p>
Erased savegame to 0 everything as usual.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2022-04-20T13:45:58Z finished windrowing.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T13:53:08Z started baling.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:13:05Z finished baling.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:14:55Z started wrapping bales.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1426.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1426.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:41:54Z finished wrapping bales.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:44:25Z started collecting silage bales.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:47:21Z first full trailer load going to biogas plant.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1449.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1449.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
After dropping first trailer load there, it said I think 24% complete and whole contract says now 40% complete.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:53:47Z 2nd full trailer load going to biogas plant.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1455.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1455.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
After this load it said 49% complete and contract menu says 59% complete heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T14:59:25Z 3rd load.
</p>

<p>
This load said ... err something, menu shows now 79% complete.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:05:15Z 4th load.
</p>

<p>
With this load contract menu said contract complete. And I still have plenty of silage bales in the field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:11:16Z first load to my own pocket (no pun intended).
</p>

<p>
Dropped this load off and biogas plant has still FOUR silage bales left from the previous load, so apparently this biogas plant processes them slowly over time. I also have 450 budget now and its increasing about dollah per second or so.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:17:06Z Finished collecting last silage bales, 10 total.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1518.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1518.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1520.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1520.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I was afraid to accept the contract reward as maybe the bales are somehow linked to the equipment they were created with and would disappear. So time accelerated until all bales were processed into biogas plant.
</p>

<p>
Its just that... I don't remember what is the time acceleration key combination <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well it was simply normal time acceleration 7 and 8 keys, the mod I'm using just add extra time speeds there. By midnight I had sold bunch of bales and rest of them were floating in the air. Budget now 31.4k.
</p>

<p>
Used tractor to push the bales so they fell to the ground and processing continued.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:26:21Z All bales sold, in-game 0714hrs, budget now 81k. Collected contract reward, budget now 119.9k whoah <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Pretty nice for a first contract. But then again, I started mowing at 1255hrs and now its 1526hrs already, so this was not exactly a quick task to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:29:32Z accepted contract herbicide spraying F57 for 11.1k, borrowed vehicles. Purchased herbicide tank for 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:32:45Z Started herbicide spraying F57, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1533.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1533.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:41:51Z Finished herbicide spraying F57, contract.
</p>

<p>
Drove tractor to the dealership, unloaded remaining few hundred liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T15:43:01Z Collected contract reward, budget now 127.5k.
</p>

<p>
It took this long of game-play to first time for me to feel like, hmm semi-blah, don't have that enthuasiasm for playing, not this terrain and yeah well this terrain hehe. On the other hand, there is nothing but boredom waiting for me by PMC DevSurf which is done by reading ukraine war news and browsing my local notes, pretty much.
</p>

<p>
But this start from zero savegame in elmcreek, dunno how much future it will have, if I were to seriously return to farmsim playing I would definitely play in one of my own terrains. I just months ago finished savegame in elmcreek so yeah not much interest in this one.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T16:11:16Z Decided to take canola harvest contract for F70, reward 25.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T16:16:22Z started harvesting F70 canola, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1620.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1620.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I do have courseplay and GPS loaded, but all these contracts I've driven manually without them. Oldschool rulez <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1628.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Elmcreek-2022-04-20T1628.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-20T17:11:32Z Finished harvesting canola F70, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T17:13:18Z Dumped canola from semi-truck into the delivery place and contract was now complete, got some money from leftovers but did not see how much as courseplay HUD crap was on the way.
</p>

<p>
Then offloaded from combines grain tank remaining 4.6k liters and dumped them into delivery place. Budget now 140.1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-20T17:15:17Z Collected contract reward, budget now 163.3k wow quite nice.
</p>

<p>
Decided to call it a night here, still not yawning but its more or less my bedtime, and as said dunno if I really want to get into farmsim now, maybe this was just one nights quick few hours of fun to get my mind a little bit away from <a href="https://pmc.editing.wiki" target="_blank">ArmA 3 editing</a>. Maybe tomorrow I'm back in full swing editing ArmA 3 again, who knows.
</p>

<p>
I have to say that IF tomorrow brings more farming... it most definitely will be in maybe <a href="pmc-super-six-6km.php">PMC Super Six 6km</a> or what was the 10km one forgot its name already heh. I just don't see any point playing in piece of crap 2km elmcreek especially as I already finished savegame here.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T00:56:51Z Deleted this savegame, sorry but like I said above, this savegame (elmcreek) has no future.
</p>
