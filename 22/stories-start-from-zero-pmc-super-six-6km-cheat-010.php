	<h2>2022-10-02 Terrain v0.2.4 Update</h2>

<p>
2022-10-02T23:55:00Z New farming day has started, actually same as yesterday so I'm not even going to repeat it here, this savegame now has 117hrs 7min on it.
</p>

<p>
Today's goal is to purchase claas lexion 8900 with header trailer (we already have the header), two bourgault 3420-100 air drills + 71300 air carts, two versatile 4wd 620 tractors and hmm what else, guess thats it.
</p>

<pre>
- harvester 18k liters claas lexion 8900 configuration big and guidancesteering upgrade 511.3k
- header trailer midwest durus 60ft 22.5k
</pre>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:03:00Z Purchased the above list.
</p>

<pre>
- tractor 665hp versatile 4wd 620 with engine upgrade and guidancesteering 413.5k
- seeder 45.8k liters bourgault 71300 air cart 331.5k
- seeder 600hp 30.5m 18km/h bourgault 3420-100 paralink hoe drill 430.5k
</pre>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:06:00Z Purchased the above twice, budget now 4.715m.
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer 9k liters 48.5m 25km/h hardi rubicon 9000 with guidancesteering 504k
</pre>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:12:00Z Purchased above.
</p>

<p>
After buying those big air drills I immediately started to feel like, hmm these are too big for this terrain heh. Bourgault 3420-100 is so fucking clunky with animations and geometry that its almost not worth to buy, the smaller drill would be better choice I think. But oh well lets see how they play out in PMC Super Six 6km terrain, first time for everything.
</p>

<p>
Check out the performance frames per second...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0022.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0022.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
There is now so much vehicles and equipment in this farm yard which mounts up to so many polygons and textures in the scene that piece of shit conzole engine FS22 gives such a poor performance in my nvidia RTX 3060 12gb TUF Gaming video card.
</p>

<p>
What the fuck is the point of multi core multi threaded software when you cannot even run a scene with many polygons or are all the farmsim base game and user created mod vehicles complete garbage without any optimization?
</p>

<p>
When I put twice as many vehicles and characters in a scene on ofp/arma I get no such performance loss.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Sent semi-truck to the dealership, need to purchase one more UTTS-32000 for liquid fertilizer transporting.
</p>

<pre>
- tanker trailer 32k liters lsfm innovations utts-32000 58k
</pre>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:28:00Z Purchased the above + main color 1k.
</p>

<p>
Refilled tanker trailer with liquid fertilizer for 38.4k. Drove it back to the farm yard, then took out first rubicon 9000, refilled it and then I were ready to start preparations for next years planting season.
</p>

<p>
Hmm not sure if F11 is worth to plant/harvest anymore as its so tiny, its like one pass with rubicon 9000 and done <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:40:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:41:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T00:44:00Z Started fertilizing CP-21, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
Okay two rubicon 9000s rocking at the field, yeah buddy! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0045.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0045.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
The massive 48.5m implement width and blazing fast 25km/h field work speed, there is just no comparison in farmsim vehicle list for this kind of spraying power. Sure john deere 4940 sprayer has even faster speed in FS19 it was 35km/h and in FS22 they neutered it down to 32km/h, but that was still much narrower boom and smaller tank capacity.
</p>

<p>
FS22 has atrociously bad liquid fertilizer usage rate, I were just in the first corner of headland and already over 25% of the tank expended, just absolutely silly numbers, where is my variable spray rate mod? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I am going to set all PMC terrains with proper liquid fertilizer use rate per hectare, that will solve the problem for once and for all as there seems to be no variable spray rate mod being released.
</p>

<p>
This is completely ridiculous, half a tank of 9000 liters expended just on headland alone, fuck that man, whoever set liquid fertilizer (and other?) spray rates in stock default game fs22 settings is crazy. I wrote my todo website issue report about it, will do the above terrain level fix for this, some people might not like it but hey tough shit.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T01:05:00Z Both rubicons empty, fuck this, saved game and shutdown FS22, going to edit that fertilizer usage to PMC Super Six 6km terrain right now...
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T01:38:00Z Oops about two minutes ago loaded game back up with PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.4 update.
</p>

<p>
Rubicons got refilled, semi-truck tanker trailer ran out of liquid fertilizer so second vehicle only got 5k liters, but with the new spray rate changes I think that should be enough.
</p>

<p>
However once rubicons were back on spraying, the liters ticked down very rapidly, hmm. I'm not expert on that one, never really monitored how many liters per second vehicle pushes out, but overall it looks like very fast rate. We'll lets see how it turns out on the long run, lets say that if this field needs another refill on top of this, then either my edits are not working or they were completely off the whack.
</p>

<p>
Semi-truck reached the dealership, topped it up with liquid fertilizer and send it back to the field, just in case.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T01:59:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-21.
</p>

<p>
Looked like multiple tools convoy distance was not working in latest courseplay, I set it to 300m and second rubicon was right on lead vehicles ass. Its always something, why cant things just work for once?
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T02:01:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, I'm so tired its nap well err back to sleep time, I just woke up so yeah its back to sleep time. I'm just snoozing off while playing, cant concentrate to muster enough good farming energy, so back to bed...
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T06:20:00Z Back, enough said, lets continue farming until have to cook some food.
</p>

<p>
So what do I got... fertilizing of F11 and CP-21 is complete for the next years planting season, I have all the sexy equipment I need so next I'll buy some land while still leaving couple of hundred thousand for product purchases. Actually I should buy those farm yards and buy product there in advanced so I wouldnt have to worry about running out of fertilizer, herbicide etc. Unfortunately base game does not have such placeable herbicide tanks to use, also seed tanks were missing actually there is only diesel fuel and liquid fertilizer, hmm. Sucks, I need to look it up if there are mods for those.
</p>

<p>
But for now, buy land as much as money lasts while leaving a small piece of cash to product.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T06:27:00Z Purchased bunch of land.
</p>

<p>
Impossible to explain so have to show a screenshot.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0627.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0627.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Those are all the southern terrain farmlands without fields in them. I am not planning on doing fertilizing contracts anymore as I have so much money and equipment, but its easy to buy these big chunks of land without fields in them so I have a good backup just in case I would suddenly run out of money so I can do some contracts to fill the budget.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking that once these fields have been harvested and I move towards north, I will buy F16-f19 etc in this southern part before migrating north bound.
</p>

<p>
This farm yard had some goodies.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0630.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0630.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
A lot of grain storage with auger pipes, then those diesel fuel and solid fertilizer tanks with "buy product here" options, as said shame there is no such thing for herbicide.
</p>

<p>
I now have 4 * meridian flat bottom bin 3609 which are 1.100m liters capacity and 4 * meridian flat bottom bin 3608 which are 980k liter capacity, so current total capacity from this farm yard is 8.320m liters <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well that solves the problem of buying new bins hehe.
</p>

<p>
Why am I using meridian flat bottom bin 3608 and 3609 together where 08 is only 980k liters and 09 is 1.100m liters, they look almost identical I initially thought they are all the same bins in 3d world but they arent, so why use 3608 which is smaller capacity but almost identical. Don't use 3608 anymore, switch the existing ones to 3609 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
That was just a global reminder for myself and well good info for everyone else, these bins look the same why not use 3609 in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 35k liters of diesel fuel for 34.3k.
</p>

<p>
These are the diesel fuel, liquid fertilizer (center) and solid fertilizer "buy product here" tanks I mentioned about.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0638.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0638.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
As you can see from production inspector mod display in top-left corner, I purchased that 25k liters of diesel fuel so our vehicle will now run for a long time. However I have 344.7k budget which is not enough to fill all the fertilizer tanks, also not sure if I even need all of them as solid fert tanks are 60k liter capacity and liquid fert is whopping 173.5k liters capacity, so that is some serious fertilizer storage globally.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping to use rubicons for my fertilizing needs even though I have the great endurance bredal k105 and k165 systems available as well.
</p>

<p>
Hmm seeds and herbicide are a big problem, I have nowhere to store them.
</p>

<p>
I quickly went to google herbicide and seed storage mods, there just absolutely have to be several of such available... Well that was extremely fast find, just typed "farming simulator 22 fs22 herbicide buy tank" to google and several good matches came up, first of course was the clickbait keyword hell modsfile file hosting using ripoff piece of shit site which name I wont mention, second was using similar keyword stuff but had its own download link to their servers without popup ads and such, downloaded it from <a href="https://fs22.com/farming-simulator-22-mods/placeable-objects/herbicide-tank-v1-0/" target="_blank">fs22.com placeable objects herbicide tank v1.0</a>, I'm not advertising that site but just noting it for reference.
</p>

<p>
But seed tank similar manner was nowhere to be found also started to waste good minutes on googling which was eating my farming time, now is time to farm its not time to search for mods, so decided to end searching. Saved game and exited, going to launch my new mods testing PMC Farm Lab terrain and drop in that new herbicide tank by Wilku, need to verify it works and is error free.
</p>

<p>
Tested herbicide tank by wilku, it works, you can buy herbicide into that tank, then refill rubicon from it. And the great thing is that you can also overload from rubicon back to the herbicide tank again, I assume this works the same way with giants original liquid fertilizer tank as well.
</p>

<p>
Inspected log file, it is clean, no errors no warnings. Okay I'm good to go to start using this herbicide tank by wilku mod <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T07:04:00Z FS22 booted back up with this new herbicide tank mod.
</p>

<p>
Purchased one herbicide tank for 46.5k, placed it on our new south central farm yard next to a solid fertilizer tank. Budget now 298.1k. Hmm I actually need to be careful not to run out of money because while three hundred grand sounds like a whole lotta money, it really ain't when you start to plant several huge fields. I recall from some old FS19 savegames that you could easily spent half a million on product alone in a huge planting season.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to conservatively purchase very low amounts of product to our farm yard tanks now, almost one refill only type amounts. My biggest headache is seeds, I have no placebale to BUY & STORE seeds, I still have to use the 32k liter tanker trailer for seeds, which of course works but its kind of black sheep of the family now as liquid fertilizer, herbicide and solid fertilizer is on this south central farm yard tank storage.
</p>

<p>
This is kind of exciting to learn FS22 placeable / mods / terrains way of doing large scale farming, what methods to use, which one of them is the most efficient etc <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
For liquid fertilizer closest to a vehicle refill size is 10k liters for 13.2k, I purchased TWO of those now.
</p>

<p>
Solid fertilizer is crazy expensive, its 10k liters for 17.6k and the tank capacity is only 60k so its fairly small. Was thinking that hmm I'm not going to buy solid fertilizer because rubicons will be my main workhorses.
</p>

<p>
Purchased herbicide 10k liters for 13.2k times two.
</p>

<p>
This amount of product wont last us through this planting season, not even close. But its a start.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm wondering about seasons days time, currently I'm running one day seasons and usually if I start harvesting at in-game 0900hrs it takes that three hours on that CP-21 field, well how many more fields can you add to that before harvests last so long that you run out of seasons days. For soybeans you can harvest two in-game days oct and nov with one day seasons, I think that should be enough for two big fields but no more, you just don't have the time.
</p>

<p>
This first planting season with all these big fields... I'm kind of chickening out and thinking that maybe I should not get greedy, only do one max two new fields, or I could simply bump the seasons days to lets say three and then this would not be an issue.
</p>

<p>
Used courseplay to drew a custom field around our new south central farm yard, this field is now called CP-24.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T07:27:00Z Finished painstakingly draw custom field outlines to all of our new fields. Yes admittedly this is much faster than actually driving the outline using a tractor or even a pickup truck, but yeah it was kind of painstaking work to accurately draw those lines in the piece of shit conzole peasant map view.
</p>

<p>
This is the list of new field numbers, memorize them as I'm going to be referencing them a lot heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0727.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T0727.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Looking at the hectares on those, it is clear that noway all this can be harvested in one day seasons.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T10:34:00Z Oh my I had to take a long over two hour break to take care of real life not really a chore but phone calls type of thing. It took a huge bite of time from today's farming session, luckily I'm good to go for days now. Just finished cooking and eating food, so the next four five hours I'm set. Burb and lets fucking farm.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at the size of these fields and decided to simply change seasons days length to 3 days, its the good old FS19 Seasons shortest number. Now its just time accelerating to was it feb or mar when the FS22 year changes, then I get the 3 day seasons and can proceed to soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
While being away and cooking food I was also considering planting canola and wheat just for a change, but it might be a dumb idea because I'm here to make money not to play with barbie dolls, wheat is not making any money for you, soybeans is the money crop. Also every other crop yields more than soybeans where the killer yield crops are corn, barley and kind of canola too, you get so much yield out of those fields that you are swimming in grain which is really bad to haul into farm bin silo and to sell, soybeans has the lowest yield in the game but also pays the most, its the money crop.
</p>

<p>
Err wait what, after time accelerating two days (one at the time), I'm now in sep 2nd in-game 0852hrs, umm where did the year actually change as I was in july and now all of the sudden I'm seeing 3 day season change, hmm this is odd, I thought year seasons settings took affect only at spring time feb/mar whenever it was. Well whatever.
</p>

<p>
As I'm time accelerating now with 3 day seasons, you can really feel the long year, it takes a while to time accelerate 12 * 3 days for a full year. But I need this, if I'm going to harvest all these fields in one seasons, there is snowball chance in hell you could do it in a single days daylight time.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T10:49:00Z Still time accelerating, its now dec 3rd heh, man it takes a while to get through these days even with 6000 speed, maybe two day seasons would have been a better compromise. Maybe I'm just spoiled with the single day seasons in this dumbed down conzole peasant FS22 too much <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T10:55:00Z Its now mar 1st in-game 0921hrs, its spring time and going to start fertilizing these new fields as that is not done yet.
</p>

<p>
Driving to the new farm yard I bought which got the name "Farm Yard CP-24" now, I was just marveling in shock that whoah dude you got some big fields here <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hehe, yeah its no joke, these fields will yield so much soybeans that in the next grain selling day it is going to be like printing money.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sent semi-truck tanker trailer with liquid fertilizer into farm yard CP-24, then refilled both rubicons.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T11:14:00Z Started fertilizing CP-24, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sent bredal spreaders to farm yard CP-24. I need to put these boys in use as well.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I wonder if my terrain maps_sprayRate.xml edit is working because rubicon 9000 is going through that liquid fertilizer like there is no tomorrow. Headland is not even half way done and lead rubicon is already 85% tank full, man that product goes fast.
</p>

<p>
CP-24 courseplay field work course with these two rubicons had some serious problems, I found the vehicles stopped in one turn for no apparent reason, when I fixed that manually then on the next turn vehicle number two stopped running the course again for no apparent reason.
</p>

<p>
What the fuck is going on with FS22 latest courseplay? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Below screenshot is not showing any issues, just an basic rubicon fertilizing field screenshot few minutes after.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1138.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1138.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-10-03T11:42:00Z Started fertilizing CP-25, courseplay 3x tools. This was done with bredal k105 and k165 spreaders.
</p>

<p>
Uuh maan these field are so huge, I cannot comprehend how many millions of liters of soybeans we'll pull off from the next harvest seasons, its gonna be crazy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Sprayers and spreaders are working hard putting some fertilizer into the ground.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1146.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1146.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-10-03T11:55:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-24.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully next fields would be much better courseplay field work courses, I don't want to baby sit when vehicles are running, defeats the purpose of such scripting tool in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Drove rubicons to farm yard CP-24, refilled both from the tanker trailer, was kind of surprised there was enough product.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T12:08:00Z Started fertilizing CP-26, courseplay 2x tools. This was started with lead rubicon while the trailer vehicle was still at the farm yard CP-24, but its no big deal, at least you avoid some collisions like this.
</p>

<p>
CP-26 being fertilized while in distance bredal's are doing the same for CP-25.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1215.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1215.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Getting CP-24 through CP-28 fertilized first seemed like overwhelming task, but so far its going great and should take not much longer to finish the remaining fields.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1223.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1223.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Been thinking if my next big upgrade to the farm would be to get rid of bredal spreaders and purchase two more rubicon sprayers, less vehicles, more width and speed, with the expense of endurance. But I have that semi-truck tanker trailer in standby to refill sprayers on the field so it shouldn't be that much of a problem.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1229.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1229.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
On the other hand if I would just upgrade k105 to k165 and get more powerful tractor to pull it, that would be just winning combination for the fertilizing endurance, four k165s in a single field and I don't think there is a field big enough in this terrain that they could not spread with on tank.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T12:41:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-25.
</p>

<p>
Purchased this SW farm yard for 16.3k, which was a bargain deal because it comes with all these placeable buildings heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1245.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1245.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This allows me to just refill some liquid fertilizer for this tank here and refill my sprayers in the boonies, no need to hustle semi-truck tanker trailer across terrain etc.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10k liters of liquid fertilizer for 13.2k, budget now 212.3k. Then refilled first rubicon.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T12:53:00Z Started fertilizing CP-28, courseplay. Created single tool course for this one, second rubicon was still busy with previous field.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T12:54:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-26.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T12:56:00Z Started fertilizing CP-27, courseplay 3x tools. Bredals on this field.
</p>

<p>
CP-27 field was design flawed, its SE tip is very narrow and these 30m width implements overlap themselves a great deal. These kind of fields are so bad and I want to get rid of them all, just need to get around to do a quick design fix.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10k liters of liquid fertilizer for 13.2k, this was on farm yard SW, then refilled second rubicon. Budget now 199.1k.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T13:03:00Z Started second rubicon in the same single tool field work course from the rear end, to help the first one out a bit. Lets get this field done.

<p>
2022-10-03T13:26:00Z CP-27 fertilizing is just about to finish, but now I gotta take a quick shower break.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T13:42:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-27. Dunno when but I came back at this timestamp. Now all fields have been fertilized.

<p>
Refilling bourgault air drill. Seems like this UTTS-32000 tanker trailer in the solid config will refill this bourgault "spoon" just nicely. 32k liters of seeds is not the best load you can carry, wilson pacesetter plus other trailers carry more, elmers haulmaster and demco 2200 carry a lot more. But dunno, lets see if I would use this refilling method now a bit.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1345.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1345.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Second bourgault only got 6.4k liters before UTTS-32000 ran ouf of seeds. Hmm wonder if this really is that good idea to refill with such low capacity hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
I was checking out lode king distinction super-b if that could be used as seed delivery trailer, its got massive 75.6k liter capacity, but I bet its a bitch to unload into bourgault air cart spoon as there are million of those hopper things to align just perfectly and trailer tires would clip the spoon etc, it just sounds like a one big mess.
</p>

<p>
Although in lode king website they had (computer generated?) image of super-b unloading into bourgault air cart, so I assume some farmers in real life do it that way.
</p>

<p>
Drove semi-truck with tanker trailer into the dealership, refilled tanker with seeds for 28.7k, budget now 170.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T14:01:00Z Bourgault 71300 air carts refilled 25.5k liters of seeds. I'm good to go for the next planting season. No idea how far I get with that 50k liters of seeds, but we'll haul some more when these big boys run out.
</p>

<p>
Drove UTTS-32000 to the dealership and topped up seeds for 17.1k, budget now 153k.
</p>

<p>
Saved game just in case and then it was time acceleration until apr soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T14:09:00Z Its apr 1st in-game 0831hrs, lets start planting.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T14:14:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-21, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1415.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-10-03T1415.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Set the convoy distance to 300m, I want them to avoid collisions in turns. Not sure if that is enough also there is a "fake" collision detection in courseplay just when two vehicles are passing each other even without coming close to touching one of them will trigger collision detection and shuts the vehicle off. FS22 garbage growing pains I guess.
</p>

<p>
I hate moving these FS22 bourgault 3420-100 paralink hoe drills when folded as they behave so badly, dunno what giants messed up with the geometry or weight or whatever but it feels like its sliding on the ground. So far when they are unfolded and you're seeding, regular field work, that seems to be working OK.
</p>

<p>
Wonder what the duration difference is between 4 * kinze 4905s and 2 * bourgault 3420-100s. I don't have my previous planting season data here to compare, but hopefully I remember do it later.
</p>

<p>
Hmm at some point when I get more money and fields, it might be good idea to buy more bourgault air drills and split the vehicles to sectors, like south and north side. On the other hand, that is more like long term split up, my goal basically is to plant every field once and after that there is no need to plant the same field ever again, unless I some day return to this savegame just as recreational farming type of thing, nostalgia or something.
</p>

<p>
Once I get this much farmland and equipment as I have now, it just might be that the savegame is on the stage that its one harvest per new field. These southern fields yield so much soybeans that after they its sold I am definitely looking something like 10 million or more, at that point who knows maybe I get to buy bulk of the remaining farmland in this terrain, dunno haven't counted but might be close. So once all farmand has been bought, well then I'm definitely in the "money and yield doesnt matter" mode where I just spam soybeans without fertilizing or herbicide spraying them as it doesn't matter and in fact it speeds my harvests as grain cart doesn't have to drive that much as yield is lower.
</p>

<p>
Anyways what was I saying, oh yeah more bourgaults hehe. Yep dunno, maybe I could buy two more, maybe the money is not enough after this and the next harvests, that I might benefit of having more air drills in more localized areas where they don't have to travel across the terrain to reach a next field.
</p>

<p>
We'll see...
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T14:48:00Z Recorded some autodrive routes, in the meantime bourgault air drills are doing good progress. I sent fendt tractors with bredals back to farm yard F11, need to hook them up with kinze 4905s and send to the next field, lets put more planting power into play.
</p>

<p>
When thinking about that plant soybeans into a new field only once principle, well hmm wonder if this CP-21 field planting in this season is waste of time, meaning that if I'm getting almost "unlimited" amount of soybeans from the next harvest, ie new fields, whats the point of spending time planting and harvesting this old field which doesn't get us any closer to the goal of harvesting all the fields. Well yes of course this field yields about 900k liters of soybeans, so of course its not waste of time in that sense, that 900k translates to over three and a half million in money which allows me to buy more fields. Dunno, its a art to balance that time use, shall I plant this field for the second time or move onto a new field, good question indeed.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T15:05:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Not sure why I planted this little girlie men field one more time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T15:28:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-24, courseplay 4x tools. These were the kinze 4905 blue drives.
</p>

<p>
Bourgault air drill number one finished its field work, 9.1k liters seeds left.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T15:32:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-21.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T15:33:00Z Even though bourgaults just finished their field work and needs to be driven to the next field, I am starving so need to grab a bite to eat before farming more, kinze's are seeding so I'll be keeping an eye on those guys while eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T15:59:00Z Feeding time is over, back to planting season. And sigh I had huge kinze collision waiting for me here, seems like FS22 courseplay is such a fucking piece of shit and step down from FS19 courseplay <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It was a motherfucking mess to start all these tractors back up to their correct course tracks, no fucking idea which was going where. Yes I guess you could avoid irregular shape fields with multiple tools, put only one tractor for such field... but yeah its just so shit, multiple tools is crap in FS22 courseplay and that's just a fact.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T16:06:00Z And again courseplay failed with kinzes, fuck this shit. I am so fucking angry I could bunch the monitor in furious anger nnnnnNNNGNGGHH! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Fuck this shit, I'll put single tractor per field from now on if I even continue this shit show <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T16:08:00Z Fuck it, i'll send one tractor to the next field, I'm done playing kiddie games <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">

<p>
What an amateur hour... this is unorganized mess. Semi-truck tanker trailer hauling seeds has to zig zag from one field to another depending which tractor runs out of seeds, just so stupid and all because of lame FS22 courseplay multiple tools makes such a mess.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T17:47:00Z Refilled kinze on CP-25.

<p>
2022-10-03T18:05:00Z Starting to yawn a bit but still doesn't feel like tired. Lets see how much longer can I farm tonight.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T18:07:00Z Refilled kinze on CP-25.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T18:12:00Z Refilled kinze on CP-26.
</p>

<p>
Refill after refill... This doesn't give completely accurate picture because now I have huge fields and small single planters, if I would successfully put four kinzes with 18.2m width into a huge field, there would not be that many refills obviously as the capacity would be multiplied by three.
</p>

<p>
But seeing what kind of a shit show FS22 courseplay is with the integrated GUI and worthless multiple tools feature, I'm thinking of getting two more bourgault air drills next year and just distribute those to different fields, then get more seed tender type trailers and put dedicated semi-truck for each air drill so there was always seeds ready to go by the field when ever the air cart ran dry.
</p>

<p>
Semi-truck tanker trailer at the dealership refilled with seeds for 22.8k.

Was waiting for last two kinze's to finish planting soybeans and already decided to that I wont be starting herbicide spraying tonight even though I still have two hours of this day left, I just have no mood for it after all this courseplay fiasco again. No idea if I'll farm tomorrow, couldn't care less if I didn't.
</p>

<p>
2022-10-03T18:56:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-25.
