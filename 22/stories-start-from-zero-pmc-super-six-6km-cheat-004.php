	<h2>2022-09-24 Soybeans Planting And Selling Season</h2>

<p>
2022-09-24T18:31:00Z New farming day has started, just updated autodrive to umm err v2.0.7 I believe, now taking savegame backups after updating the bat to delete giants savegameBackup dir first, that dir always eats GIGABYTES.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 40hrs 38min on it.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T18:35:00Z In-game and its jul 0011hrs umm why did I save game at middle of the night, that is odd heh. Okay time accelerating until morning daylight. I now usually go for in-game 0900hrs regardless of the month, ie length of the day, its always daylight and the disgusting "morning farmsim glow" has mostly disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Alright a recap; jul in-game 0930hrs, nothing planted, no grain, budget now 1.511m.
</p>

<p>
Case IH magnum afs connect series on sale for -44% hmm its nice but not nice enough to buy right now. What I need is powerful combine and header, or even something better than topliner with 6m header.
</p>

<p>
Sent fendt 939 vario to the dealership to pickup kinze 3665 blue drive planter. Picked it up and refilled with seeds 3876 liters, then drove fendt 939 vario back to F11 N farm yard.
</p>

<p>
Alright, good morning. Just woke up, did morning computer chores, did not eat yet, created <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=78&t=22778" target="_blank">FS22 USA North Dakota Finley 10km terrain design 1 project screenshot</a> for ARG_afb in PMC Tactical forum as he wants to do that terrain next. Then grabbed new autodrive version, checked courseplay but no updates, then started PMC Gaming computer up and loaded this savegame and here I am, good to go for another almost 17hrs farming day.
</p>

<p>
Today's goal, well nothings changed from last night, what did I say again... buy big farmland and courseplay splice it up to small sections and start farming it with kinze 3665 + topliner with 6m header, right?
</p>

<p>
Today I don't feel like doing contracts no more, oh hell no, I got all those contract juices squeezed out of my system yesterday pretty good.
</p>

<p>
Contract board had F25 barley harvest for 865k profit, but its estimated duration is 12hrs 56min, with "must deliver" 2.6 million liters, that is pretty sick. There is also couple of very profitable canola harvests which would be fun to do. But no, no more contracts, I have plenty of money for my own farm and I open the flood gates when I unleash kinze 3665 into a big field.
</p>

<p>
This is the farmland I am eyeballing right now. As seen its 110.2 hectares for 1.046m price.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1855.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1855.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
That could be split up to so many small sections for farm, maybe paint the dividers with grass landscaping tool or something. Or if I would manage to get better combine, who know maybe I'll just do everything in soybeans heh.
</p>

<p>
Farm grain bin silo is not to be ignored, when I go this big field route I absolutely need a big grain bin.
</p>

<p>
Another option would be to buy already pre-set farm yard farmland with several bins, then I would only need to buy auger pipe to fill those bins.
</p>

<p>
Our current farm yard which I actually don't own, just borrow, is completely empty. Started to walk / run around the farm yards seen on the map, first one in SW is empty. South central one is big with 8 meridian auger pipe grain bins, fuel and water tanks, liquid and solid fertilizer tanks. Farm yard in SW (not the tip one, but next to it) is similar setup. SW tip yard is empty. Central, NW and north central are empty. NE one has 8 meridian grain bins + other stuff.
</p>

<p>
Well here I am again, I cant make up my mind, cant make a decision, hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T19:04:00Z Going to eat days first meal while contemplating my next move, gotta make a decision what to buy ...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T19:36:00Z Feeding time is over and contemplation done. Except... I did not contemplate much, not to any degree of decision at least heh.
</p>

<p>
OK enough bullshit, lets get this show on the road. Purchased the 1.046m big farmland right next to F11 N. Budget now 464.5k.
</p>

<p>
Intersection with tiny tractor next to it, thats the fendt 939 vario and field just front of it is the farmland I bought. It is MASSIVE, relatively speaking.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1942.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1942.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
It definitely has to be split up to small sections so its more manageable to work on. Soybeans is the money maker but I sort of wanted to do others as well, guess those have to wait though as why make them as I have no grain mill or grass mowing equipment etc.
</p>

<p>
Kinze 3665 will handle pretty big areas and our fertilizing fleet can do the whole field if necessary, actually I'm going to fertilize the whole field just because. And then at harvest time, unless I get a good sale on some combine, I'm stuck with that small topliner with 6m header.
</p>

<p>
Hmm after giving it a bit more thought, why fertilizer the whole field if you are not going to seed all of it. So going to start by making decent size field outline section for it where I plant soybeans that topliner combine can handle, or rather I can handle the harvest time heh.
</p>

<p>
Recorded courseplay rough outline for a small section of the field, its called CP-19 now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T19:49:00Z Started fertilizing CP-19, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1951.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1951.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Hmm this is ugly shape and perhaps a bit too small, hmm I need to try the courseplay manual drawing of field outlines to make another one, better more square size shape.
</p>

<p>
CP-20 custom drawn field saved. Hmm.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1954.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T1954.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-24T19:59:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-19, it was a mess heh had to abort the course as vehicles collided.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T20:00:00Z Started fertilizing CP-20, coursepay 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
Felt weird doing small section of this huge field, hmm. No idea if this is already too boring for 6m combine header to work on, or turns out to be too little that hooyah gimme some more hectares biatch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I bet during the planting season or maybe even before harvest, there will be some good big combine on sale and I buy it. That would be cool. So definitely need a 13.7m header, at least bare minimum 10m, would be awesome to get midwest durus but I don't recall seeing those on sale yet. Dunno what combine would be good, I got a bit over 400k to spend so with good sale guess everything is possible.
</p>

<p>
Another thing is that kubota sprayer, its 28m so its decent width but the speed is excruciatingly slow 12km/h it just crawls a snail pace on the field, I hate those. Unfortunately the only faster sprayer is the 36m berthoud bruin 4200, which actually would be a good compromise between now and rubicon 9000. Have to keep my eye on sales for both.
</p>

<p>
That kubota sprayer is quite cheap with good liter tank, so perhaps buying another one of those for our second tractor would be somewhat balance for the slow speed, spraying capacity would be over 50 meters wide then.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T20:11:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-20. Courseplay as usual missed couple of small spots, but I wont worry about those now.
</p>

<p>
Was browsing dealership menu, kubota (mod pack) actually has pretty nice sprayer stuff, front tank 5k liter capacity and tow behind sprayer with 15k liter capacity, unfortunately tow behind is as usual 12km/h which is terribly slow. Once you get taste of rubicon 25km/h speed, you just cant go back to these mickey mouse 12km/h junk sprayers.
</p>

<p>
If you want even more speed, john deere 4940 or whatever the model was, self propelled sprayer goes 35km/h which is so fast sometimes its difficult to drive on those pass turns heh.
</p>

<p>
Hmm looks like custom group reduced the speed to 32km/h now in FS22 version <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=179136" target="_blank">giants modhub</a>.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T20:26:00Z Now time accelerating until I reach next YEARs soybeans planting season. Hmm. I was thinking about planting wheat and canola as I could do that this year, but nah, one step at the time, first I do soybeans and hope to find better combine. Also I still need a grain bin silo option of some sort, I cant start harvesting without any bin.
</p>

<p>
Nearest big farm yard with buildings including grain bins is "only" 50k which is very doable purchase, but again ... its a bit off, its the south central farm yard. Sure guess I could take it, 50k would be cheaper than to actually buy our own farm grain bin silos.
</p>

<p>
Smallest unia bin silo is 117k, meridian is 72k, neuero 198k. AGI pack has some cheap ones, but those are also terribly small, I bet I get more soybeans out of those fields than what the smallest AGI bin holds, also agi needs auger pipe to work.
</p>

<p>
Too bad there is no sales options for placeable farm grain bin silos heh.
</p>

<p>
Dec in-game 0939hrs dealership has bourgault 3320-76 paralink hoe drill on sale for -55% off, that would be a nice deal... but not really needing one right now and unless you have whole lotta money its not a good idea to buy stuff just because you get them cheap. Also good point that once you have millions, why would you even bother checking dealership sales hehe.
</p>

<p>
Jan in-game 0929hrs convey-all cst 1550 is on sale for -49% off, that would be useful, but I don't have a semi-truck yet. Currently nothing but cultivating contracts available, its dead of winter.
</p>

<p>
Feb in-game 0926hrs bredal k165 is on sale for -55% off, nice. I'm not exactly needing one right now, but I have to say this offer is one I cannot refuse heh. So I bought it, with extension and 6m spreading unit it cost total of 45.9k. Sent fendt favorit 515c to pick it up.
</p>

<p>
When reached the dealership almost started to regret buying k165, if I buy every cheap thing that is on sale, soon I have no money left and bunch of "useless" stuff just for the future date when I might need them. I need to keep my eye now solely on harvesters and sprayers as those are the weak link (as said placeable grain bin silos will not be on sale).
</p>

<p>
Hooked up strautmann sek 802, loaded remaining big bag's of seed to it, then drove back to F11 N in our borrowed farm yard. Speaking of borrowed farm yards, I could simply drive into any of the existing TrailerParkFarms buildings and store our vehicle there because the doors open even if I don't own the farmland. Doors open but bin silos and fertilizer tanks etc will not work. I'm not one of these guys who parks vehicles into sheds, it has no functionality or benefit / gain in this game, its pure role play, playing with barbie dolls type of stuff, so I don't bother with it.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0951hrs soybeans planting season is here, time to get to work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T21:09:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
I love it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2110.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2110.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-24T21:14:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
This kinze 3665 blue drive air drill is fun to use, loving that air pump whine <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T21:16:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
This is bad as you cant really see where you have seeded before, hmm wonder if there is some field prep like cultivator, disc harrow or something thing going on that because I did not use it, field surface looks like this, hmm cant remember.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2117.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2117.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Its very enjoyable to farm your own field with this air drill bought on SALE at the time when I didn't even need it yet <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2125.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2125.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I want to get some cultivator like disc harrow or something. This field type I'm direct drilling into, its... its.. somehow, odd. I want the field to look traditional farmsim field black dirt from cultivator which then turns into lighter shade of kind of smoother dirt after seeder runs over it.
</p>

<p>
There is already bug report about PMC Terrains FS22 to change this manure field texture type back to traditional plowed or cultivated.
</p>

<p>
Putting some soybeans into the ground, looking good.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2136.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2136.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Wrote several PMC Terrains FS22 bug, ideas and improvements reports about many things. Several good fixes in my mind.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T21:41:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-19.
</p>

<p>
Our first big field seeded with soybeans, cool <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T21:43:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-20, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Currently planning that if I were to buy that south central farm yard with all the buildings on it, that would increase my grain bin silo capacity a huge amount, well going from zero to millions, there would be what was it 8 bins, I could plant sorghum and oats before this planting season is over, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Maybe, maybe. We'll see how bored I am after CP-20 is done. (I think there is a screenshot above but CP-20 is the second and bigger custom field outline I did).
</p>

<p>
If I were to seed oats and sorghum, harvest season with topliner 6m header will be a lot of laughs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Jumped out of the tractor, just sitting and chilling at the field here, listening to the wind noise and birds... (yeah yeah shut the hell up I know fs17/19/22 environment sucks but still), just enjoying myself watching courseplay run that kinze air drill back and forth planting soybeans. Just so nice and relaxed, ahh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2152.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2152.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Hmm after I chill a bit, going to buy the kubota sprayer front tank to existing one and then full sprayer set for second tractor. It should be enough spraying power even with the 12km/h slow speed.
</p>

<p>
Got trailer full of seeds waiting for when kinze runs out.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2159.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2159.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This kinze 3665 blue drive with its 12m width and 18km/h speed is such an huge improvement to the whatever euro trash 3m piece of shit seeder I used previously. Just so nice to run this cool planter.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:05:00Z Okay kinze 3665 ran out of seeds, refill time!
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2207.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2207.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
After refilling the planter dropped off strautmann sek 802 autoloading trailer to the farm yard, picked up kubota xms218 sprayer and sent tractor to the dealership for an upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Earlier I spoke about sorghum and oats, well yeah I don't have a seeder for those, unless you want to use the 3m piece of crap heh.
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer 7.5k liters 28m 12km/h kubota xms218 with working width and capacity upgrade 43.8k
- sprayer 5k liters (front tank) kubota xft211 with capacity xl 6.4k times two
</pre>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:18:00Z Purchased the above equipment. Budget now 344.6k.
</p>

<p>
Purchased a herbicide tank for 2.4k times three.
</p>

<p>
Refilled kubota sprayer setup and sent fendt favorit 515c back to F11 N. Back at the farm yard dropped off the sprayer equipment and headed back out to the dealership. Ping Pong.
</p>

<p>
Purchased a herbicide tank for 2.4k times seven. Refilled kubota sprayer + front tank, then send 515c back to the farm yard again. I am all topped up here with herbicide poison.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 320.6k. Buying an combine + header might be difficult now unless there will be really good sale.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:38:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-20. Didn't notice when this finished, it was done after I was done refilling kubota, nice.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:47:00Z Started herbicide spraying CP-19, courseplay 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
Now this herbicide spraying is not "printing" anything on the field, it doesn't turn dark, without courseplay you would have no clue where you have sprayed already. I hate this stupid field stage system <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2248.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2248.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And then vehicles collided, guess this was far from optimal field size for these implements and now I have absolutely motherfucking zero clue where my second vehicle should continue spraying <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'll just don't, I'm not going to guess.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:56:00Z Finished herbicide spraying CP-19.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T22:57:00Z Started herbicide spraying CP-20, courseplay 2x tools. Same here, no field texture changes so impossible to see where you have sprayed before.
</p>

<p>
Vehicles slightly collided at the end of headland but they managed to struggle through it, good. Overall I'm somewhat happy with the performance of 2 * 28m width and 12km/h speed, its not too bad. I mean it looks really slow and its utterly boring to watch, but guess the speed of which field overall is done, taking a note about the herbicide tank capacity... is pretty OK, for this price range.
</p>

<p>
If you want to remove any frustration, use only one sprayer tractor per field, so there wont be any chance of collisions. You could first let go the leading vehicle and once it completes headland then send off second, but that is kind of blah, why use two vehicles in the first place if you run them almost one by one. Dunno.
</p>

<p>
I must say, that liquid tank capacity is extremely impressive, it puts rubicon 9000 and any other to shame, 12.5k liters for a tiny tractor. It might be worth to get dedicated narrow tire small tractors for this spraying job, maybe even do fertilizer using it, even though bredal k165s are the endurance king of course.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:13:00Z Finished herbicide spraying CP-20.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:17:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:19:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:21:00Z Started fertilizing CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:23:00Z Started fertilizing CP-20, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing works normally.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2323.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-24T2323.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:31:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-19.
</p>

<p>
Once fendt 939 vario freed from CP-19 field work I added it to the rear end of CP-20 course, a little help there to save time.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:40:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-20.
</p>

<p>
Okay fields seeded soybeans, herbicide sprayed and fertilized two stages. I am good to start growing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Cant wait to see how the herbicide sticks in these new fields as texture did not change color at all. If it fails well then it fails, but at least currently standing at CP-20 it shows yield-bonus 95%, 100% fertilized and no weed info, so things are looking good.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm desparately hoping that some nice big combine sale would appear before harvest season, because if it doesn't, then these fields will take a long time to harvest with 6m header.
</p>

<p>
And I still have to pull the trigger with buying that farm yard with buildings. In a way I feel like its a bit cheating, its 50k and the buildings alone on that yard cost hundreds of thousands if you buy them separately, so its a bug or well design flaw in PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.3 and all other FS22 terrains, farmland price has not been adjusted for the buildings. So buying that farmland lot with 50k would be "get buildings for free" type of deal heh. If its a terrain bug... its not my fault, right? Err <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hah I forgot to herbicide spray F11 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

2022-09-24T23:48:00Z Started herbicide spraying F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-24T23:52:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F11.
</p>

<p>
There, oversight fixed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now F11 has less than yield-bonus 95% because that oversight, herbicide "burned" soybeans plants a bit, it looks like its somewhere between yield-bonus 90-93%. Oh well did not write step by step field work plan so was easy to miss.
</p>

<p>
CP-20 has few spots that courseplay missed, but CP-19 unfortunately has few passes "spots" which got missed because the vehicle collide and impossible to tell which part of the field is sprayed and which is not. Oh well next season I only set off one vehicle per field, or something.
</p>

<p>
Bunch of fertilizing contracts appeared and they are all manure or slurry borrowed vehicles, sigh. It might be worth to contact better contracts mod author to let him know, I hardly ever see rubicon 9000 there. Who knows maybe its some field size thing too, maybe those fields are too small I don't know, but yeah manure and slurry spreaders for contracts is NOT HAPPENING situation.
</p>

<p>
Aug in-game 0945hrs, soybeans are growing very nicely and there was a lot of money to be made in fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
But as I said earlier today, there wont be any fertilizing contracts, been there done that and have almost PTSD alike symptoms about them heh. I love working my own ground instead of someone elses. Already getting excited that what the yield will be for our three fields.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0921hrs soybeans harvest day has arrived, they are ready to harvest. Dealership has claas trion 750-720 on sale -59% off, nice deal but hmm dunno its not really the kind of combine I'd want to buy.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T00:09:00Z I'm actually going to eat lunch now before starting harvest season, there is no rest for a while when that kicks off so better have some chow now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T00:35:00Z Feeding time is over, lets start harvest season!
</p>

<p>
Beautiful thing.
</p>

<p>
Alright lets break out the combine and get to work <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T00:39:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T00:55:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F11. Yield was 7587 liters. There was some issue with farmland image on terrains v0.2.3 that I managed to plant the far edges of the field, but this combine cannot "reach" them. Nothing can be done about it in-game.
</p>

<p>
It was really fun, enjoyable and relaxing to harvest this field driving using GPS in-cab view. Now I wanted to do first of the big fields the same, but wonder if its such an good idea after all, it might take a really long time. But then again its either in combines or grain cart tractors cab, so dunno.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T01:00:00Z Started harvesting soybeans CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Yup decided at the last minute seeing the field up close and personal that yeah nope, let courseplay handle it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But I'm still going to sit in combine as passenger for a while, its so relaxing to harvest soybeans.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T01:06:00Z First round of headland done, got 5.8k liters from that alone. Nice.
</p>

<p>
Cutting it open.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0121.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0121.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Topliner 4090 HTS combine auger pipe is not working properly with demco 2200 dual auger grain cart, there is extremely narrow spot on the carts edge where it does work but its tricky to keep it aligned there. Hmm hopefully this will not be a problem, I would not want to use those small grain trailers, but dunno maybe eventually I have to.
</p>

<p>
Just chillin', waiting for combine to fill up...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T02:14:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans CP-19.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T02:15:00Z Started harvesting soybeans CP-20, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
This will take a while heh. Also demco 2200 grain cart is getting quite full, with this CP-20 field it will get full and ... then what, where am I going to dump all that grain uuh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Headland on CP-20.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0223.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0223.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-25T02:42:00Z Demco 2200 grain cart is full <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Dropped off demco grain cart to the farm yard and picked up the brentner and welger grain trailers.
</p>

<p>
Was checking out those farm grain bin silos and auger pipes, that free AGI pack has some cool stuff. However I just realized that unless I've forgotten I never used auger pipes in FS22 only in FS19 and those of course are different mods. I don't know which auger pipes work with what grain bin silo, and as usual the game itself has no fucking info which works with what. So now I'm basically forced to either savegame and exit to test and learn, or simply just buy that cheapest smallest regular dumb farm bin silo where you drive and dump without auger pipes.
</p>

<p>
The farm yard costs 50k but meridian bins there require auger pipe. So it would be 50k + auger pipe price and then HOPE it works with the bin.
</p>

<p>
I wrote todo task for myself to research, learn and document the whole AGI pack plus previous in-game grain bin silos, I don't ever want to feel as helpless as right now, big field is being harvested and dude is like <i>"err the fuck am I gonna put all this grain, bro!?"</i> heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T03:18:00Z Both grain trailers full, ugh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0318.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0318.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-25T03:23:00Z I chickened out and purchased unia farma 400 + obi 1000 "ready to use" grain bin silo, drive to it and dump or unload. I'm sorry but I need to learn all that new auger pipe bullshit in some test savegame other time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This unia bin cost 117k, budget now 197.6k.
</p>

<p>
Dumped the small grain trailers into the unia bin silo, then back to the field to offload combine which already was full. Now I'll get through this harvest season and actually I'll have the capacity quite far even when adding more field outlines to our big farmland. Unia farm 400 is 400k liter capacity. If I would still run out of space, those silo extensions for unia are quite cheap 52-64k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T03:42:00Z Now I felt the first time like this deutz fahr topliner 4090 hts combine harvester is so slow its going to take forever, as is already been taking really long time. I would say that for next year, I'm going to sell this topliner and purchase a new combine, even if it means I need to grind some fertilizing contracts for hour or two, but this just cant go on like this, too slow, too small.
</p>

<p>
To put it simple; I am bored. Somewhat frustrated and disappointed because that lack of grain bin knowledge.
</p>

<p>
As for buying an combine harvester, unfortunately its quite grim situation, cheapest 13.7m grain header width combine is case ih axial-flow 9250 which cost 410.5k + header 89k == half a million, ugh.
</p>

<p>
In my rough overview either you go super small equipment like I am now or then jump directly into the big boys league which is the half a million costing 13.7m header width level.
</p>

<p>
There are various other header sizes in-between, but honestly those feel like waste of money half-in-half-out type if solutions, just do couple of more harvests with shitty equipment and then jump straight to the big boys stuff, why waste time and money by gradually upgrading while going through these in-between sizes.
</p>

<p>
Dunno.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T03:52:00Z And another 26.5k load of grain full, off to dump it into farm bin silo.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T04:25:00Z Trailer full, off to dump.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T04:49:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans CP-20.
</p>

<p>
Uuuah! Our big farmland two fields have now been harvested for the first time! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Farm bin silo got 92.5k liters of soybeans + demco 2200 grain cart 77.5k liters so total: 170k liters.
</p>

<p>
In the end it did get a bit boring and honestly now that I've just parked vehicles and thinking what to do next... and the idea came to mind that continue fertilizing fields for the next season, it felt like "argh noway!" heh, dunno maybe I need a quick break or something at least lunch break. What would change in the next harvest season is really nothing dramatic, sure the combine will be upgraded but so what, its just different color machine running back and forth on the field a less time, its not something "game changing" which would peak my interest.
</p>

<p>
But anyways still a bit time before lunch break, was going to write that time accelerating to soybeans selling day but it always catches me off guard that nope, the next step after soybeans harvest is the new planting season because high market price day appears between planting and harvest; so its harvest - planting - selling - harvest, cycle with soybean crop <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm guess I'll try to see if I can fertilize our fields before lunch break in about half an hour, lets get to it.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T04:59:00Z Started fertilizing CP-20, courseplay. This was done with fendt 939 vario and bredal k165, biggest field for biggest boy.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:01:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:03:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:04:00Z Started fertilizing CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Here I go, preparations for next years planting season have already begun. The never ending cycle of farmers life.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:14:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-19.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:18:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-20.
</p>

<p>
Our fields have now been fertilized. I was planning on increasing fields on this big farmland, but first I need to nail down that combine upgrade otherwise it would just take too long tomorrow to harvest all these with topliner 4090 hts.
</p>

<p>
Just finished, saved game which I haven't done in HOURS heh, and now alarm went off; days third meal, perfect timing this is awesome. I'm off to grab a bite to eat while thinking what to do with last 5hrs of this gaming day and in upcoming soybeans planting season and combine upgrade.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T05:47:00Z Feeding time is over, lets finish this day gloriously.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that I cannot hope that some big combine goes on sale before next harvest season, so I have to be prepared to buy one with my own money. So I checked how much I would get from topliner and its header, well its only 16.5k for the header and measily 80.1k for the combine, was thinking of selling those as they are really not needed anymore but 95k is peanuts, it makes no difference if I talk about those half a million costing combines, so I might as well keep that little guy as memento nostalgia thing as backup.
</p>

<p>
So how do I make money in farming simulator? By doing contracts. Well I don't want to do contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Heh, ookay, well now I have a problem <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm going to time accelerate towards soybeans planting season while thinking about this.
</p>

<p>
Jan in-game 0927hrs dealership has Kinze mach till 261 on sale for -60% off, nice deal but my plans prevent me from buying it. Not that I've done much tilling lately anyways, there is just no need for it with direct drill planters.
</p>

<p>
Feb in-game 0927hrs john deere t560 harvester is on sale for -39% which is not great, also it uses peasant 7.6m header so only 1.6m upgrade to our current combine, doesn't sound like worth the money (sale or not sale).
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0841hrs well soybeans planting season has started, better get to work. Unfortunately nothing has changed combine wise, I am in the same situation as before, I have seeds so this planting season wont cost us anything, perhaps some diesel fuel few hundreds but otherwise I am pretty much good to go. Hmm maybe herbicide, haven't checked that status.
</p>

<p>
I have to be honest, planting season while it was fun and exciting earlier today when using kinze 3665 in this savegame the first time, it doesn't sound appealing at all now, it takes so long time when courseplay is running the tractor. But maybe I could watch some youtube videos while it does, so lets get to work, lets get this thing done.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:06:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Here I go, look at those weeds heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0606.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-25T0606.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:10:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:11:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
And now I'm off to find some entertaining FS22 youtube videos or perhaps to browse mod websites etc. I cant think of what could I do while this guy is seeding, yes I need to grab strautmann sek 802 autoloading trailer with seed big bags, but that is probably an hour to this seeding or something, but in any case I'll do it now so I'm ready to go when the call comes.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:36:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-19. Oh CP-19 did not require planter seed refilling, it went all in one go, still have 49% of planters seed tank capacity left.
</p>

<p>
Drove fendt 939 vario with kinze 3665 blue drive into CP-20, generated courseplay course, then drove strautmann fendt next to the planter and refilled it full.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:39:00Z Started seeding soybeans CP-20, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Okay now back to entertaining myself anyway I can while kinze is planting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Blah boring stuff, so back to farmsim. Lets start herbicide spraying while seeding is still going on.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T06:58:00Z Started herbicide spraying F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
This field again did not change color at all, no way to tell where have I sprayed earlier... But I guess with GPS and courseplay that is not really an issue... unless you have courseplay vehicle collision and have to abort the course.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:00:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:02:00Z Started herbicide spraying CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Putting soybeans seed to the ground and spraying some poison as well, uuh yeah, getting it done.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:17:00Z Finished herbicide spraying CP19. Actually it was finished when I ALT-TABbed back <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Getting close! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2022-09-25T07:27:00Z Finished seeding soybeans CP-20.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:30:00Z Started herbicide spraying CP-20, courseplay 2x tools. Then decided to give lead tractor some time to complete headland before starting second vehicle so I don't have collision which could mess up the whole course (no marks on field surface so no way to tell what has been sprayed).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:49:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:50:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:51:00Z Started fertilizing CP-19, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:52:00Z Finished herbicide spraying CP-20.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T07:54:00Z Started fertilizing CP-20, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Things got rolling pretty hectic pace now, had to stop youtube video I was watching or listening on the background so I can fully concentrate on handling these tractors and everything related. Good stuff.
</p>

<p>
Now if solid fertilizer would last for this planting season end it would be great.
</p>

<p>
Its actually interesting that my day still has two and a half hours left, I can easily reach the next harvest season in today's farming session. Now the question remains... with what combine <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:01:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-19.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:02:00Z Went to help fendt favorit 515c who was spreading CP-20, I copied the courseplay course and started to reverse from the back end towards the upcoming other tractor, I meet in the middle.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:08:00Z Finished fertilizing CP-20. That is it, soybeans planting season for this year is a wrap! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Maybe it just feels like it as I didn't do contracts, but I have gotten tons of work done to my own land which is great.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:13:00Z Alright now just time accelerating until I'm at jun soybeans best selling day, I'm trying to be very careful this time that I don't miss the highest peak of the price which seems to come BEFORE midnight, which is kind of odd.
</p>

<p>
May in-game 0946hrs soybeans are growing great, dealeship had sale for kubota fertilizer spreader and quadtrac, but they were in the 40s and yep again not needing those right now. Also fertilizing contracts were without rubicon but overall net profit was over half a million combined from all of them in the board now, there would be some money to be made.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0933hrs nothing interesting on sales or contracts and now I'm slowly hour by hour start to track soybeans market prices.
</p>

<p>
At in-game 1334hrs soybeans market price 3755 and rising. At 1615hrs its 3802. At 1724hrs its 3817. At 1813hrs its 3825. The market price increasing or decreasing marker icon is irrelevant at this point as it shows decreasing but actual price still increases, it seems like there is two masters on the whole market price thing, the arrow and then something else actually artificially pushes the price up. Very weird.
</p>

<p>
Anyways looks like I have a good price this year. I would like to see how high it goes, but also for once, I would like to haul grain to the selling point in daylight <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Currently highest market price is on PMC Sell 02 which is the second closest selling point to F11, its actually in west corner of our big farmland lot.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:43:00Z Okay decided to go sell now as I still have a bit of daylight left, lets do it.
</p>

<p>
Our farm bin silo now has 92.5k liters of soybeans, market price in PMC Sell 02 is 3822, our budget is 196.4k. Starting to haul using the small grain trailers until bin silo is empty, then hauling demco 2200 as well.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:49:00Z Brentner trailer load gave 70.6k, welger gave 30.5k.
</p>

<p>
The reason I'm not hauling all of the grain using demco 2200 is that it is SO sluggish with fendt 939 vario heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T08:55:00Z Brentner trailer load gave 70.6k, welger gave 30.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T09:01:00Z Brentner trailer load gave 70.6k, welger gave 30.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T09:06:00Z Last load delivered to sell from farm bin silo, it sold for 49.9k as it was not full trailers. On previous delivery night had already fallen, now its basically pitch black dark and I still have to haul that pig demco 2200.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T09:14:00Z Sold last of our soybeans from demco 2200 grain cart for 295.7k, budget now 845.9k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then drove fendt 939 vario with demco 2200 back to our borrowed farm yard and parked it. Time accelerated to the morning daylight. I had just one hour of today left before 17hrs been awake alarm would go off, instead of pushing into the soybeans harvest season of which I obviously could not finish tonight, I decided to call it a night regarding FS22, I want to do couple of computer chores before going to bed so this is perfect time to call it. Tomorrow I'll surely continue and then I have harvest season with new combine purchase waiting for us.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-25T09:21:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, its time to chill.
