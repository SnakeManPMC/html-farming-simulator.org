	<h2>2022-04-24 Herbicide Spraying Festival</h2>

<p>
2022-04-24T06:38:21Z New farming day has started, FS22 back up and Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km loaded up. Let's spray <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Had 4.3k liters / 48% of product left in the tank but decided to hop back to the dealership for a refill before heading out to the next group of contract fields. Fill her up.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 4k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T06:49:15Z Arrived at F183, opened the boom, ready to start spraying. I love this shizzle so frigging much! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Smiley :mrgreen:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T06:58:14Z Finished spraying herbicide F183.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T06:59:03Z Started spraying herbicide F268, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0703.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0703.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:05:07Z Finished contract on F268.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:07:24Z Started spraying herbicide F266, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0708.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0708.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:10:12Z Finished contract on F266.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:11:04Z Started spraying herbicide F265, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:13:26Z Ran out of herbicide, heading back to the dealership for a refill.
</p>

<p>
Soon I'll need to buy semi-truck with liquid tanker trailer to haul some product for me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
Restarted game for some game.xml edits, bumped up viewDistanceCoeff and lodDistanceCoeff to 3 and foliageViewDistanceCoeff to 2 (assuming it is a bump up). Then added Contract HUD mod which should show me the progress on contracts, it would be really helpful.
</p>

<p>
Also change savegame directory names so that Spring Creek 12km Start From Zero is number one, not number twelve which was annoying to scroll into.
</p>

<p>
When seeing Contract HUD in-game the first time was really disappointed that it shows all contracts, now this would not be a problem for farmer who only has one of two active contracts... but I currently have SEVENTY THREE (73), so the list goes top down across the screen which is unacceptable. Contract HUD would be awesome if it only listed contracts with more than 0% completion, or otherwords would filter out 0% completed contracts.
</p>

<p>
Wonder if I could get in touch with the author to add that feature, hmm.
</p>

<p>
But at least you can turn it on and off with ALT-M.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:37:16Z Finished contract on F265.
</p>

<p>
Even though 73 contracts on the screen was unacceptably intrusive, it did help me to keep track on the progress, so while its really ugly, its still useful for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
Next is a big F182, this will take at least one refill for sure heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T07:40:37Z Started spraying herbicide F182, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0746.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0746.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Ran out of herbicide as expected, refill time. I am thinking more and more of purchasing semi-truck with liquid tanker trailer because driving back and forth for refill with rubicon was fun at start, but now it becomes a chore...
</p>

<p>
Budget now 321.9k so would have plenty of money to buy such setup, but dunno, I want to get my own rubicon 9000 with GPS first.
</p>

<p>
Who knows maybe after this huge batch of spraying and fertilizing contracts are done, then we move in the season to the phase where different kind of contracts are available.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T0827.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-24T08:27:51Z Finished contract on F182.
</p>

<p>
Next was another big field, F179, even larger than what got just finished. Cool.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T08:30:27Z Started spraying herbicide F179, contract.
</p>

<p>
Ran out of herbicide, off to the dealership for a refill. Current budget 421.3k and plan is to get enough money for a rubicon 9000 with GPS so I can start to use GPS heh, then continue doing fertilizing/spraying contracts until have enough money to purchase semi-truck with liquid tanker trailer.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
Ran out of herbicide, back to the dealership we go. Uuh, we need a variable spray usage mod for FS22 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
Ran out of herbicide, back to the dealership, again and again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 10k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T10:35:35Z Finished contract on F179.
</p>

<p>
Uuuh that was a looong contract! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Collected contract reward which was quite a big too, budget now 608k. Enough to buy my own rubicon 9000. Off to the dealership <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T10:43:29Z Arrived to the dealership, unloaded herbicide from the sprayer, collected contract reward for F335 which returned the borrowed vehicles, budget now 655.1k oh my.
</p>

<p>
Saved game, just in case, have some precious progress here unsaved at the moment.
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer rubicon 9000 with gps 504k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above, budget now 151.1k.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T1047.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-24T1047.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Felt so GOOD to have my very own rubicon 9000 with GPS, now I get to use GPS and courseplay finally, no more pain and suffering trying to decipher where is the weeds area in the field, heh, awesome! <i>Edit: this is not according to original <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=22739" target="_blank">Start From Zero - Getting Started and Rules</a> which state that you have to own vehicle AND land to be able to use courseplay/GPS.</i>
</p>

<p>
Plan is and I assume will be using GPS quite many hours now, somehow it feels like why use courseplay with a single vehicle especially as its so piece of crap GUI intergrated in FS22. Maybe if I buy the semi-truck with liquid tanker trailer and haul some product while courseplay runs the sprayer on the fields, dunno.
</p>

<p>
But for now, hours of enjoyment with GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T10:54:15Z Started spraying herbicide F247, contract, with GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
<i>Edit: aaand there you go, using automation tools before you own land and vehicle is against Start From Zero game-mode rule set, this savegame is now invalid. Shame on you.</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T11:06:08Z Headland done and engaged GPS the first time, ahh my good old frield <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2022-04-24T11:47:45Z Ran out of herbicide, its time to buy the semi...
</p>

<p>
Mack pinnacle 6x4 semi-truck was on sale for err dunno how many percentage off, bought it for 40k. And UTTS-32000 liquid tanker trailer for 58k. Budget now 53k, just enough to buy some herbicide heh.
</p>

<p>
Purchased herbicide tanks for all the money I had, budget now 217 heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T12:00:17Z Refilled, back to spraying.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T12:04:05Z Finished contract on F247.
</p>

<p>
Next was F309 which has few gaps in it but overall its probably one of the biggest today. Its now pitch black night time, hmm I'll start this field but most likely have to give up and time accelerate until morning daylight, its a new terrain and all I don't want to work at night in darkness.
</p>

<p>
Nevermind, after driving to the field edge in darkness, yeah I'm so going to time accelerate for daylight. Its now in-game 1947hrs. Time accelerated 5000 speed to in-game 0650hrs, goood moorning Spring Creeeek! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T12:09:09Z Started spraying herbicide F309, contract.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately right after beginning headland game started to say <i>"you have no access to this land"</i>, now it could be just contract bug but it could be some issue with the terrain, dunno. End result is, have to cancel this contract.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2022-04-24T16:16:47Z Feeding time is over, alright last call for tonight, whoah where has this day gone, feels like I just got started. Anyways lets press on for few more hours, but I think this savegame "for now" has ran its course, there is not much more to gain unless I expand into buying land and more vehicles for various field work categories, and for that, I'm not sure its time yet... definitely not today. Somehow I feel that tomorrows plan is to do something else, not sure what but just not continue this savegame.

We'll see how it goes. For now, few more herbicide spraying contracts.

This is another big field and definitely will be last for today, if I even have patience to finish this one, I think there is annoying tanker trailer refill coming next etc.

And now its time to call it a night, well not for me but for this savegame session, I'm going to chill rest of the evening instead of burning myself out with this herbicide spraying grind which changes nothing in grand scheme of things, I mean how much money do you really need?
