	<h2>2022-12-23 Courseplay Issues Mount Up</h2>

<p>
2022-12-23T03:57:00Z New farming day has started, I am burnt out and bored, yesterday spent full 17hrs day doing absolutely nothing, was just reading / watching ukraine war news living from one news item to the next, was quite terrible. Months ago I had the plan for holiday season 2022 to buy good food and just enjoy playing Farming Simulator 22, well since then a lot have changed and I already sort of did that playing thing, but why not try to achieve that holiday season 2022 goal now anyways.
</p>

<p>
So after getting morning chores done and days first meal in, I switched over to PMC Gaming computer, updated garbage win10 and now I'm ready to launch garbage fs22. Today's goal would be to continue trying to finish soybeans harvest.
</p>

<p>
This savegame has 144hrs 6min on it now.
</p>

<p>
Today I'm expecting to get frustrated with shitty courseplay same as previously, but this time at least the farm grain bin silos gets sold and the good old drive through bin is going to replace those so I can setup autodrive to handle all grain hauling.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T04:04:00Z Claas lexion 8900 combines refueled.
</p>

<p>
Selling meridian flat bottom bin 3609 gives 25.1k cash, well hmm that is not much but hopefully its enough to buy even smallest drive through grain bin silo. Sold three 3609s, budget now 74.7k. Then sold four meridian flat bottom bin 3608's for 21.5k each, budget now 161.1k which is enough to buy farma 800 + obi 1000 grain bin silo setup for 147k. Budget now 14k.
</p>

<p>
Farma 800 + obi 1000 grain bin silo setup gives us 800k liter capacity, I don't have more money to buy extensions so this is enough for maybe one more field of harvest, after that I have to sell directly to get more money for silo extensions.
</p>

<p>
I placed this farm 800 to center of F39 S farm yard, should be easy enough to do autodrive route.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T04:17:00Z Autodrive route recorded, it was easy indeed.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T04:25:00Z Recorded further route waypoints around F44, E side, and made a grain cart overloading point to F44 N side. Now I'm good to go to start harvesting F44.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then restroom break before generating combine courseplay field work course and launching them off...
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T04:42:00Z Courseplay field work course generated, this field shape is one of those fucked up irregular ones, especially the SW tip that I just knew running the course would lead to crazy combines and extreme frustration. But I'll try to savegame often and keep a cool head that things WILL BREAK so get used to it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T04:43:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F44, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 2hrs 11min.
</p>

<p>
Oh, now I see courseplay has the duration marked on the mini gui.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay fucked up combine number two animations and the "mode", sigh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0450.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0450.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Not sure how to fix that fucking thing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Had to stop the combine, DEV CONSOLE empty the grain hopper tank and then open up combine and start courseplay course again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
When I said I'll savegame often and be prepared for frustration with calm head... I didn't expect the first issue to come up withing first fucking five minutes of gameplay, before the second headland corner for fucks sake! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Fuck I'm so pissed right off the bat, win10 + fs22 + courseplay gui SUCKS ASS! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
First grain cart load I drove myself to farm yard F39 S and dumped it into meridian 3609 auger pipe.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of a very bad irregular shape field, this is a bad bad courseplay field. I thought that forest patch was cute while drawing the GIMP design doc, reality unfortunately, is a bit different. This is horrible feature in a field shape, courseplay cannot generate more than one headland for this (with 4*18.2m tools), so that feature should have been placed in middle of the field edge or perhaps even an middle of the field as island.
</p>

<p>
Learn from experience, write this to terrain knowledge database so future design doc drawings arent made as poorly as this.
</p>

<p>
unloading...
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T05:26:00Z Headland complete, taking a quick restroom break while combines do the stupid courseplay headland victory loop.
</p>

<p>
Had fuckup with autodrive silo unloading target, fixed that. Then combines 2 and 3 collided in a turn. Frustration level is growing...
</p>

<p>
Overloading...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0556.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0556.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Unloading action at the grain bin silo.
</p>

<p>
Cut her open...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0614.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0614.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Wait up...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0630.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T0630.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-12-23T06:56:00Z Combined one and two collided on turn, sigh. This seems to be the fs22 courseplay gui trend <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was just about to write that besides the initial fuckup, this field work course went through fine, but no... massive fuckup at the end when two combines collided and fs22 awesome physics kicked in with headers getting stuck together like glued.
</p>

<p>
All the garbage that fs22 + courseplay gui is, it feels like overall through out a large savegame you would probably save time by driving a single combine manually with GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Driving manually with GPS would be very relaxing, of course it would take a lot longer than four combines, but still there would be NO courseplay fuckups which cause rage quits.
</p>

<p>
Had to drive grain cart tractor to soybean crop because the fucked up courseplay course positions. Just didn't give a fuck at this point.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T07:12:00Z Flat bottom bin 3609 auger pipe loaded bitch is full, 1.100m liters of soybeans.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T07:14:00Z Combines collided at the turn again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T07:24:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F44.
</p>

<p>
Is it possible to do frustration free harvest with 4 tools using fs22 + courseplay gui?
</p>

<p>
There still was three fields left, F44-F43. One of them big and two medium sizes, overall harvest time is several hours for sure and the amount of grain bin storate space needed for soybeans, hmm two more farma 800 + obj 1000, or many many silo extensions to the current one.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T07:31:00Z Last semi-truck grain trailer dumped into farm yard F39 S grain bin silo. Now farma 400 + obj 1000 contains 877k liters, farma 800 + obj 1000 contains 652k liters and meridian flat bottom bin 3609 contains 1.100m liters. Combined is 2.629m liters.
</p>

<p>
And now... was not tired and not even furiously angered at the moment of typing this... but I simply just want to savegame and exit because one more courseplay fuckup and it would be a bad moment.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T07:34:00Z Saved game, shutdown fs22.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T11:25:00Z Same farming day continues, this savegame now has 147hrs 34min on it. I took a nap and ate some tasty food, now got nothing else that is interesting so lets continue harvesting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
First issue I need to fix is the farm grain bin silo, I need a lot more. There are some meridian auger pipe silos but as said you cant use autodrive with those so they are useless to my farming style (courseplay + autodrive).
</p>

<p>
Farm yard by F43 W got set of four meridian flat bottom bin 3608's and 3609's, those could in theory be used directly with grain cart tractor, but as I saw earlier with F39, it will get stressful for sure. The capacity is there, I could easily harvest the remaining fields into these grain bin silos.
</p>

<p>
Sent lexion 8900s using autodrive to edge of F43 soybeans field. Looks like autodrive does what its told, taking the scenic route, blah, would have probably been faster driving combines straight across empty field manually.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T11:45:00Z Sold four meridian flat bottom bin 3609s for 25.1k each. Sold four meridian flat bottom bin 3608s for 21.5k each. Purchased farma obj 800 + obj 1000 for whatever 147k, budget now 53.4k.
</p>

<p>
I had to sell those farm yard purchased grain bins so could buy this drive through one, but this only has ?k liter capacity without extensions, so this will also not hold ALL of the soybeans grain coming out of these remaining three fields.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T11:55:00Z Semi-truck grain trailer autodrive route setup for F43 E grain loading and F43 W silo farm yard dumping. Semi's are lined up ready to offload grain cart.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T11:58:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F43, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 2hrs 18min.
</p>

<p>
Its now oct 1st in-game 1657hrs so not many hours left before darkness, hopefully I manage to harvest this field before night falls. I can already see the disgusting farmsim glow on the horizon, ugh.
</p>

<p>
Cut that shit...
</p>

<p>
Aaand I'm unloading...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T1228.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T1228.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-12-23T12:30:00Z First headland complete, grain cart unloaded (again), now its perfect time to take a quick restroom break <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T12:35:00Z And when I returned courseplay greeted me with berserk combine, number four had taken off to random path and courseplay disengaged itself. Deep sigh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Had huge fucking difficulties getting the combine back on course, it just wanted to go where the fuck ever. Extremely just mind bogglingly fucking frustrating <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T12:56:00Z Continuing to resolve courseplay combine number four issue, no luck. fs22 courseplay gui SUCKS. I am asking myself, why am I suffering with this shit when I could be playing FS19 instead? WHY? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I tried several times get fourth combine to start using nearest waypoint but nothing, it just stops and then drives off to some fucking unknown location. It was hopeless. I had to drive this right(2) course MANUALLY <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
fs22 courseplay gui sucks so bad <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T13:29:00Z Finished manually driving combine number four headland <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T1329.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-12-23T1329.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-12-23T13:33:00Z Finally got combine number four into its correct course when those inner rows started to be harvested <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This truly feels like historical moment that I'm playing my last fs22 session here, or well harvest I hope.
</p>

<p>
Okay now its in-game 1851hrs and I cant see the combines through the darkness.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T14:47:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F43.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-23T14:55:00Z Parked semi-trucks, shut everything down for the night. Saved game and exited fs22. Dunno why but at least I need a break, just don't feel like starting the next field right away.
