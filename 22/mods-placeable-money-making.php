	<h2>Enercon E-115 EP2</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Agrartechnik Nordeifel. From modDesc:
</p>

<p>
FS22_enerconE115.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: Money making cheat placeable! Generates profit hourly. Turns into wind. Has kind of silly looking red lights in the tower "leg" but these and the red blinking light on the top is SO dim you can hardly see them, actually you CANT SEE THEM if you just glance at the tower. Generates just silly amount of money and is very expensive to purchase. Rotating blades are much more detailed than in enercon ep4 and "wind turbine package" models.

FS22_Enercon_EP4.zip

<p>
Notes: Money making cheat placeable! 2022-01-13T01:52:58Z tested, no errors. Has night lights on bigger models, turns towards wind, rotates slowly and majestically. Generates profit hourly. Turns into wind. Has kind of silly looking red lights in the tower "leg". Top red slow blinking light can be seen other side of PMC Farm Lab unlike "wind turbine package" mods light. Two placeables costing 400k and another two 500k, sizes are 129m and 159m. Two options for both sizes, 9.6k/month and 12k/month revenue. Much bigger than "Wind Turbine Package" model. The tower leg in this model is very thick and tall, rotor blades feel short in comparison. Model looks much lesser quality/design than "Enercon E-115 EP2" mod.

	<h2>Enercon EP8 Windturbine</h2>

<p>
v1.4 by FSven. From modDesc: E126 EP8.
</p>

<p>
FS22_Enercon_EP8.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: 2024-05-22T05:31:00Z tested, no errors, no issues. Includes two placeable objects, "Enercon E126 EP8 135m Hubheight" and "Enercon E126 EP8 135m Hubheight with daytime lighting" both same price and I assume 800 money producing per day, no idea whats actually different between these two placeables. Models are european wind turbines with low quality textures, not much scratches and grime on textures. At night time light turn on, blinking red light on the top and set of two lights on the tower part. Turns to wind direction. The propeller has wind "whooshing" sound, except you cannot hear it on the ground so its useless. When you place these in easy game-mode/setting, SHIFT-P generators menu shows 19,000/month as income. Works as advertised I guess.

	<h2>Wind Turbine Package</h2>

<p>
v1.1 by Razak, from modDesc: A package consisting of 3 wind turbines that adapt to the wind direction and speed.
Snake notes: Generates profit hourly. Turns into wind. Has overall massive majestic look as they are big. Cool red slow blinking light in top of the tower (no dumb lights in the tower "leg" itself). This red blinking light only works in very short distance which is a huge let down. Doesn't have placeable automatic ground texture painting (not a big deal, just saying). There are three price / revenue options, icon images do look like different sizes, however to my eye they are all the same model actually in 3D in-game, but they are slightly different sizes, just hard to see. Much smaller than "Enercon EP4" wind turbine model.
Wind Turbine Large:
Price: 1,200,000 $
Income per Hour: 350 $
Daily Upkeep: 100 $

Wind Turbine Medium:
Price: 960,000 $
Income per Hour: 280 $
Daily Upkeep: 80 $

Wind Turbine Small:
Price: 768,000 $
Income per Hour: 224 $
Daily Upkeep: 60 $

	<h2>Wind Turbine</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Michu77. From modDesc: Wind turbine that adapts to wind direction and speed.
</p>

<p>
FS22_WindTurbine.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: PMCTODO (UTC) Tested (RESULTS_PENDING). Another imaginative mod name. This is the first american style white wind turbine you see on iowa, indiana, ohio etc midwest american farming areas. All I can say is... its crazy that nobody has modeled a real american style wind turbine before, I'm very glad this was released finally (still haven't tested so crossing fingers no errors etc). This is blatant cheater generator, $5,000 per hour income.
