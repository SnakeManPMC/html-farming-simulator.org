	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This story in the beginning references a lot of what happened earlier today which was explained in <a href="stories-release-and-install.php">FS22 Release and Install</a> story, please read that first so you understand the context of New Farmer Elmcreek story. If you don't want to read that through, well then all I can say is <i>I don't like win10...</i> which is an understatement, so bare that in mind if you proceed to read without going through FS22 release and install page. New Farmer Elmcreek story has some profanity in the early pages which all goes with the release and install story background, if you are child who gets offended by strong language stop reading now.

<p>
New Farmer Elmcreek savegame story is my very first time playing Farming Simulator 22 (FS22), fresh of a new game release and me getting it installed. This was extremely exciting time for me to learn this new farmsim game. I have fond memories of this era when playing through New Farmer game-mode in FS22, I'll never forget it (with help of this story page) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
This savegame is also the very first I finished in FS22. This means buying all the farmland and harvesting all the fields, just like <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=22739" target="_blank">Start From Zero - Getting Started and Rules</a> savegames.
