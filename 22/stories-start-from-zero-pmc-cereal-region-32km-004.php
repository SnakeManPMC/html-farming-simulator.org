	<h2>2023-01-29 Purchasing Own Land Equipment And Vehicles</h2>

<p>
2023-01-29T17:12:00Z New farming day has started, last night when chilling before going to bed I read through the above story and felt like I want to take this savegame from contracts money making to harvesting your own fields stage. Today I did some mod testing and this day is about half way done more or less, but going to begin farming.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 43hrs and 14min on it.
</p>

<p>
Activated new landoll 7431vt 33ft disc and GtX seed cleaner mods, I highly doubt I'll be discing any fields but still its a good implement, seed cleaner is kind of fun to use and always has that magical feeling using the seeds you created yourself.
</p>

<p>
Did a small video capturing into PMC Cereal Region 32km Start From Zero showcasing vehicles, contracts and the land we own heh. F442 is land area of 4.1ha and field area 2.87ha which is pretty accurate field definition, maybe the field is 3ha in cultivator_density dunno.
</p>

<p>
The first question is what kind of seeder, harvester and grain trailer do we buy, those are the essentials we are missing now. We have rubicon for both fertilizing, herbicide spraying and semi-truck to pull grain trailer.
</p>

<p>
My tractors are new holland t6.175 so pitiful 169hp there is no seeder in this planet I could use in 32km terrain with that tractor heh, so need to buy both seeder and tractor to pull it. There is a huge difference in seeders / planters between low horsepower and high horsepower requirements on giants default vehicles (no mods), 180hp kverneland optima rs is quite decent planter and everything better than that and you jump into the 300hp range which requires completely different tractor.
</p>

<p>
My budget is well over two million so seeder + tractor is no problem, however I need to consider combine as well. Put together my first list, yes we are in megalodon 32km terrain but I still wanted to feel a bit new farmer feeling with medium size seeder and harvester. Oh also I put grain bin silo to the list because of course we need one of those.
</p>

<pre>
- trailer 40.8k liters wilson pacesetter 59.5k
- planter 180hp 9m 18km/h 2.6k liters kverneland optima rs 89.5k
- harvester 9.3k liters new holland ch7.70 with guidancesteering 282.5k
- header 8.5m new holland varifeed 28ft 48k
- tractor 200hp kubota m8-201 with narrow twin wheels frontweight 400kg and guidancesteering 196.8k
- placeable drive-thru farm bin silo 500k liters unia farma 500 + obi 1000 125k
===
801.3k
</pre>

<p>
Well that still leaves us well over one million in budget, I might even try to purchase more land with rest of the money heh. I am getting excited about this little farm growing project which is great because earlier today I was unmotivated and bored to do anything, I love it, so nice to get that enthusiasm and "drive" back to do anything <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Parked vehicles (except combine harvester I left at the dealership for now) to my "farm yard" and saved game, oh boy I already forgot how long it takes to save game in 32.7km terrain, wow it takes a while <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 1.850m, still so much money, we probably can buy far bigger farmland than our kverneland and ch7.70 combine is capable of working.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T17:52:00Z Started fertilizing F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T17:56:00Z Finished fertilizing F442.
</p>

<p>
Drove kubota m8-201 with kverneland optima rs into the dealership and refilled with seeds... was shocked to discover this "beast" of a planter took only six hundred and sixy (660) liters of seeds! What!? Are you kidding me!? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah dude, I don't think we are going to run back and forth to the dealership to refill if this only allows mere hundreds of liters capacity, this is... this is useless seeder.
</p>

<p>
Create a definitive list of SEED CAPACITY seeders and planters, so you never have to discover how atrociously bad capacity some of these seeders have, what fs22 shows you as capacity is complete horse shit! Don't believe it, 80% of it might be for fertilizer which is meaningless, you are not buying an fertilizing machine, you are buying a SEEDER / PLANTER! I now wrote it down for kverneland optima rs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:04:00Z Purchased new seeding options fertilizing inactive kverneland optima rs and sold the default off for 71.5k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:09:00Z Started seeding soybeans F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Yeah buddy! Seeding our very first land <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was thinking about buying more land as I have the money, but nah, I want to enjoy Start From Zero with my very first land, field, alone, its just so much more traditional enjoyable small scale farming (in 32.7km x 32.7km terrain haha) to get started with <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1821.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1821.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:22:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F442. That was fun! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:26:00Z Purchased iconik's herbicide refill station placeable for 7.5k or something, refilled rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:28:00Z Started herbicide spraying F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1828.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1828.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:30:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F442. Well, that was fast <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then I did fertilizing headland to fix the edges (beyond field definition).
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1837.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Now my very own field has been planted soybeans, fully fertilized and herbicide sprayed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I had 37 fertilizing contracts active, decided to cancel them all to be nice for the AI farmers, I'm not going to do them, there is no point with having 1.813m in budget and own field growing soybeans. Its an endless game of doing contracts, those will never end in terrain of this size and as the saying goes, how much money is enough.
</p>

<p>
Now just time accelerating using traditional 5000 sleeping speed and see whats happening next.
</p>

<p>
Jul in-game 0925hrs soybeans are growing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1849.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1849.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-29T18:51:00Z Now its my lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T19:14:00Z Feeding time is over, how are my soybeans doing?
</p>

<p>
Sep in-game 1004hrs, soybeans growth stage 5/6. Looking good. Getting excited seeing my crop grow. While eating was thinking that this soybeans harvest season will be our very special first one, but after this I want to seed wheat as soon as possible so we get a source grain to GtX seed cleaner, I want that thing to start producing seed. Maybe this F442 would become our seed material field and then farm would grow by purchasing new farmlands with bigger fields for soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0741hrs soybeans harvest season has arrived and we are still 5/6 growth stage. In 32.7km terrain these field stages change exruciatingly slowly, I am going to wait patiently while field stage change passes through north to south, I can see from mapview its already going through the northern part, soon it'll reach this central location and F442 should turn harvest ready.
</p>

<p>
But I must emphasize it is taking really really long time, literally minutes in real life time just sitting here waiting for field stage to switch.
</p>

<p>
Ah it changed to "6/6 (forage)" in this pass, hmm maybe its in-game tomorrow then. Drove new holland ch7.70 combine harvester to F442 SE corner already to wait.
</p>

<p>
Nov in-game 0923hrs same stage in the morning but in mapview can see other fields stages changing so going to wait patiently until that "wave" reaches F442. Guess this is the life you live with 32.7km huge terrain sizes, have to be patient and careful with field stage changes, also maybe its required to keep time acceleration to 1000 speed, not sure. But yeah I'm in no rush, cant wait to get started though.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T19:30:00Z F442 soybeans is ready to harvest! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1932.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1932.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Going to do this harvest manually with GPS, also as you can see from the screenshot... farm grain bin silo is right next to the field so there is no need for grain trailer to be involved heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T19:33:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Whee! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1936.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T1936.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
But on as a side note, that fruit_density.gdm crop accuracy is pretty bad, its like 1-2m off and especially when aligned with header like that, header missing so much fruit... yeah it really doesn't look too sexy <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But its the price you have to pay for making a HUGE 32.7km terrain with giants bullshit conzole engine using 16384 pixel resolution density images <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I hate to say I'm slightly shocked how bad the crop accuracy is, I knew that there is a slight problem... but did not expect it to this bad. This is FAR beyond FS19 16.3km terrain with 8192 res density images... which is odd because this terrain size is 32768 x 32768 meters and using 16384 x 16384 pixel density images which is exactly half, it is the same with 16384 x 16384 meter FS19 terrain using 8192 x 8192 pixel density images... hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
First combine unload <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2023-01-29T19:52:00Z Second harvester tank 93% full, unloading
</p>

<p>
Last pass...

<p>
2023-01-29T20:00:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F442.
</p>

<p>
First own land field harvesting is done <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2002.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2002.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Farm grain bin silo has 23.4k liters of soybeans from this first harvest.
</p>

<p>
It was a great start, now we can continue growing by buying more farmland, nice size fields and ... well depending on how crazy I get with those purchases, I would need better equipment as well, the problem is that you cant really have both, 1.812m in cash is not necessarily enough to buy a lot of land and vehicles capable of working those new hectares. I might have to buy land first and only field work small portion of a bigger field before getting more money to better equipment. Obviously there is no point putting all the money for insane large farmland if you have no vehicles to work it, hmm but yeah buying fancy equipment now with this puny 3ha F442 is not optimum either. So... umm sorry, I'm rambling again, back and forth <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T20:06:00Z Started fertilizing F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Lets put first layer of fertilization in, I want to make this a wheat field next.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2007.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2007.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-29T20:11:00Z Finished fertilizing F442.
</p>

<p>
Was eyeballing new farmland to buy, 38 is 9.8ha for 93.8k, 39 is 9.4ha for 89.7k, 42 is 10.9ha for 104k. Money wise all these fields would hardly make a dent to my budget, might be even possible to upgrade seeder and combine, hmm or maybe I'll try to do ONE more harvest season using this equipment setup.
</p>

<p>
I would still like to get a bit more suffering in before upgrading to more larger equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T20:56:00Z Purchased farmlands listed above, budget now 1.524m. New fields are F455, F454 and F453.
</p>

<p>
F455 is ready to harvest sunflowers but I am not going to harvest them, wont be doing field flipping kind of thing here, not to mention I have no corn header currently.
</p>

<p>
Its now in-game nov, so plenty of time accelerating to do before getting into soybeans planting season again, at that time I'll leave F442 for wheat and plant these new fields. So going to start fertilizing these two new fields, I believe sunflower F455 will remain in its current fertilization stage when it withers over the winter.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T21:10:00Z Started fertilizing F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Yeah its crazy, budget is still 1.524m after purchasing these new farmlands, heh wow farmland was cheap and we had a lot of money. Could still buy more stuff <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm while fertilizing F454 and looking at the other fields nearby... man this next harvest season is going to be a tough one with current planting and harvesting equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But, I love it, I'll get it done, the more I suffer in the beginning the more I appreciate the big boy toys once I get to them <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T21:18:00Z Finished fertilizing F454.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T21:20:00Z Started fertilizing F453, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T21:24:00Z Finished fertilizing F453.
</p>

<p>
Did fertilizing outline for F455. Saved game. Then it was time accelerating towards soybeans planting season again, not a full year but over the winter so yeah it will be quite few days of skipping. Wheat planting season comes much later so still have to buy seeds before get to have GtX seed cleaner to run my own seeds.
</p>

<p>
Until soybeans planting season I'm going with 5000 speed, dunno if I need 1000 speed, if there is a problem with my own field stage changes then need to use the slower speed, but that is a problem more after planting season.
</p>

<p>
Brrr.. <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2143.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-29T2143.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Apr in-game 0553hrs soybeans planting season has arrived, OK.
</p>

<p>
Purchased two big bags of seeds for 1.6k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-29T21:49:00Z Started seeding soybeans F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Planting soybeans, aayeah!
</p>

<p>
Hmm this might actually take a while using 9m planter, these are not a big fields... but make no mistake, this planting season is not over in half an hour, not even close. Guess the overall planting hectares without the F422 upcoming wheat seeding is hmm close to 30ha.
</p>

<p>
I love this, I don't mind if this harvest season is taking a while, I love farming I love doing this Start From Zero in 32.7km terrain, I love all of it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Almost done, few more passes.

<p>
2023-01-29T23:42:00Z Started herbicide spraying F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Was going to take a screenshot about herbicide spraying, but there honestly is not much to see as field texture color does not change, sure there is background landscape, but yeah well.

<p>
2023-01-29T23:56:00Z Started herbicide spraying F455, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:01:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F455.
</p>

<p>
As for fertilizing, F453 and F455 only need edges done but F454 needs full fertilizing.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:05:00Z Started fertilizing F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing F454, getting it done.
</p>

<p>
This is nice long field, not too large but still you get that feeling of long passes to work on.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:10:00Z Finished fertilizing F454.
</p>

<p>
Fertilized edges on F453.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:21:00Z And F455 fertilizing edges done, saved game, just in case. Now soybeans planting season is over! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Next up is end of jun when soybeans highest selling price is, however I am not going to bother to sell my 23.4k liters which is not even a full truck load, there is plenty of grain bin silo space so better to wait until next harvest season is done. Jul begins wheat planting season and then I need to plant F442 for our seed cleaner source thingy.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:31:00Z Sold kverneland planter as it cannot seed wheat, and this was the end of the road for this planter because next season we will definitely buy bigger planter for my large scale operations.
</p>

<p>
Only thing now to do is to buy a wheat capable seeder and with kubota m8-201 horsepower tractor... dunno what that would be, hmm, maybe I just lease some small and figure out a better seeder later hmm.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:38:00Z Purchased pottinger terrasem c6f with seeding options, fertilizing inactive, for 109.5k. Then purchased two big bags of seeds and refilled pottinger. Budget now 1.476m.
</p>

<p>
Tried to start seeding wheat on F442... but game said this crop cannot be seeded in july, huh what, went to calender and wheat HARVEST season is now, planting season begins in sep <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I need to google and find some realistic american seeder and planter for the small to medium scale, this should actually be quite easy because these are quite popular, at least they should be, obviously most popular are some euro trash 2m plows type crap, but I assume there are more small to medium size american equipment in many mod makers neighborhoods than there are some massive bourgault air drills etc. Also seems like nobody likes playing large terrains so all they care about is small fields and equipment anyways.
</p>

<p>
Sep in-game 0931hrs, okay lets start seeding wheat to F442 so we can get seed cleaner going <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T00:49:00Z Started seeding wheat F442, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Hmm this pottinger really sucks, 6m width and 15km/h speed.
</p>

<p>
But yeah it sucks, I'm going to search some realistic small / medium size american planters real soon.
</p>

<p>
This pottinger is 6m width and with 32.7km terrain using 16384 pixel density images, crop accuracy is so low that it seeds now too wide area, probably like 7 or maybe 8 meters, this implement is too small for terrain of this size, that is not an joking insult but a technical fact haha!
</p>

<p>
I must say what an horrible little seeder, this is going to be first and last time using pottinger terrasem c6f in this savegame and most likely in fs22 in general heh. Good thing about medium or large implements is that they can be used to small fields (I'm not talking about tiny fields now), it is just a bit overkill.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T01:14:00Z Finished seeding wheat F442. Then sold pottinger terrasem c6f for 86.5k or something, good riddance.
</p>

<p>
Now its my lunch time, getting hungry...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T01:46:00Z Feeding time is over, now we get to harvest season, yeah!
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0854hrs soybeans harvest season has begun, now just have to patiently wait until ready to harvest field stage. And few minutes later it happened, okay we are ready to go.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T01:52:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F454, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Harvest time!
</p>

<p>
Reached end of the first pass and harvester grain tank was 51% full already, well this would be pretty even then always unload combine at the west end of the field.
</p>

<p>
First combine unload.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T0200.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T0200.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
End of third row harvester tank was only 45% or so full, interesting how big difference there was between the edge and this row, hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
While harvesting was thinking about future plans for my farm, hmm, first instinct was to buy more farmland to get bigger fields more hectares which would equal more soybeans liters, right? WRONG -Arnold Schwarzenegger voice.
</p>

<p>
Heh, indeed. So if you have a lot of land but small or tiny vehicles like I have now, then you are wasting your time just endlessly working on those large fields. It would be much better situation to have few small fields like I do now, but then big powerful equipment which would blast through the fields "within minutes", these fields are now all close to 10ha which is ... yes small, but these are not elmcreek 2km little girlie men small. You can put rubicon 9000 and bourgault 3420-100 air drill to these fields, no problems, for example these southern long fields are rubicon two passes and then one 26.5m narrow work with boom setting pass.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T02:40:00Z First full semi-truck wilson pacesetter load taken to the grain bin silo.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T03:02:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F454.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T03:04:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F453, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T03:29:00Z Another grain trailer load to the silo. With this dump grain bin silo now has 104.8k liters of soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Hmm looking at how much time this soybeans season has and will take, its going to be best part of my day, there is not many hours left after harvest season is over. I can buy some new vehicles and started with planting season... but not much more, depending how tired do I get, I have a lot of enthusiasm and motivation right now so I want to rock all night heh.
</p>

<p>
But clearly a full next years harvest season is out of the guestion, well depending how monster vehicles I can buy of course... but it would be just too long time.
</p>

<p>
Done.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T04:06:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F453.
</p>

<p>
One more field to go, it also is the largest, not by much but its 10.x hectares, shape is more box alike, not so long passes which will save harvesting time as you don't have to turn all the time.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T04:09:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F455, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
This should be another one hour harvest, at least, lets see how accurately we end this on 05:09 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T04:19:00Z Only now I setup autodrive to drive semi-truck grain trailer, nick of time eh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Ready for the next unload.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T05:31:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F455.
</p>

<p>
Uuh finally harvest season is over.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T0532.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-30T0532.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I say finally because now I'm tired, eyes are very strained and mind is getting into that zombi mode. I love farming (todays session) but when you get too tired its just not fun anymore, you are just going through the motions, muscle memory, that is not fun.
</p>

<p>
Wheat harvest was still to do, wait first when its ready to harvest, but yeah I am going to call it a night here and go to sleep, tomorrow I'll continue because I want to see what kind of vehicles my farm will get, plus that GtX seed cleaner get to be in action. Yeah I should be editing stuff, but hey.. heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-30T05:38:00Z Saved game and shutdown fs22, goodnight.
