</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T02:01:00Z Started to fertilize fields, lets put some oats down.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T02:20:00Z Got sudden extreme tiredness, eyes were closing and was snoozing off while playing, had to stop to take a nap. This is my first FS22 nap heh.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T04:59:00Z Woke up and back at PMC Gaming, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
And right away fucking win10 update makes me reboot, SIGH <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T05:44:00Z After 24min of win update reboots I was back in the win10 desktop... which had no audio, it was all quiet, it was dead. So had to search and found into that I need to re-install audio drivers. I did that and audio came back.
</p>

<p>
I was so angry that Darth Vader was in the corner in fetal position crying terrified out of his mind by my anger.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T06:03:00Z Finally seeder hit the field ground, back to seeding oats.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T07:24:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F10, accepted reward 11.2k
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T07:33:00Z Finished contracts for F21 and F24 which were tiny, rewards 446 + 1.3k heh not worth even to drive into those fields. Elmcreek piece of shit 2km x 2km little girlie men terrain.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T08:15:00Z Finished herbicide spraying oat fields.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T08:27:00Z Jun 1st, barley field is ready to harvest but I'm going to wait until the wheat field is ready too so I can lease combine and do both fields at once.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerating days and new vehicle shop sales came on.
</p>

<pre>
- seeder john deere 1775nt 3524 liters 16km/h for 84k (-64% discount)
- header john deere hd50f 15.2m 10km/h for 25.7k (-74% discount)
</pre>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T08:37:00Z All fields are now ready to harvest, oats and wheat too, time to lease combine. Unfortunately I ran out of money hehe, could not lease john deere x9 even though I had the header for it, so I leased that case ih 9250 with 13m or something header, good enough for this job.
</p>

<p>
I really start to hate to be broke like this.
</p>

<p>
2021-11-28T08:42:00Z Started to harvest.
