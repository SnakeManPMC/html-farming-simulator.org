	<h2>Animals Guide Chickens (FS22)</h2>

<p>
Chickens eat basic grain and produce egg pallets.
</p>

<p>
Barley and wheat can be fed to chickens directly, no processing or mixing required.
</p>

<p>
Chickens seem to really breed out of control once you reach certain level of them, or maybe it was my initial purchase of them not sure. At first I bought 4 chickens and 1 rooster, then addition to chickens I got 1 sheep of each four brands, now chickens only have two brands / types, a "chicken" and a "rooster". So again don't know if it was my initial purchase of "chicken 4" so that 4 is now multiplied over and over again, or are chickens just configured to breed so much more, really dont know yet. Anyways point being, when I was still at 32 sheeps in one sheep barn, I already had THREE (3) chicken coops with hundreds of chickens, you could say chickens will breed out of control <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
