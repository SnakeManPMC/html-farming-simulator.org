	<h2>2021-12-09 CTD Galore</h2>

<p>
2021-12-09T04:21:00Z New farming day has started.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T04:22:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Heheh un-fucking-believable.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T04:35:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T05:05:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Went to the bathroom and when I came back FS22 was not running anymore, hehe.
</p>

<p>
Getting really fucking tired of these CTDs, went to "C:\Users\ugah\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2022\" dir and deleted shaders cache dir and the *.dat files in the dir (hopefully the dat's were something to do with shaders). Then SHIFT-LMB clicked fs22 startup icon and chose verify files. It asked for serial key for online activation which was odd.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I didn't burn one serial key activation because of the DAT files in that dir heh.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T05:16:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
So much for that theory, shaders cache dir has nothing to do with it.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T05:28:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
This is unfucking-playable.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T05:36:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Fuck this shit, I'm outta here, I'm done with fs22 shit.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T10:42:00Z Was bored, burnt out for winter bullshit (real life chores) pressure, didn't know what else to do so started testing different nvidia driver versions that maybe one of those could have at least less crashing version than the latest I'm using now.
</p>

<p>
Fucking audio was completely dead in win10 on this startup, sigh.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T10:53:00Z CTD. nvidia 497.09
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T11:05:00Z nvidia 472.12 installed and savegame loaded.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T11:13:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T11:28:00Z nvidia 456.71 installed and savegame loaded.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T11:28:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
? nvidia 471.68 installed and savegame loaded.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T12:01:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T12:33:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans. Got 402.1k liters from this harvest, oh my! Started to haul it ...
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T12:35:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Whole win10 went frozen while I was typing that above text while fs22 crashed. Firefox on second screen disappeared, the screen went totally dark. So shut down text files etc what I could and did cold boot for the whole fucking system. Going to install those latest nvidia drivers back just because.
</p>

<p>
Took out bunch of mods that aren't really essential for game-play, even better time scale etc, just to give me some peace of mind that maybe some of these mods caused something. Its stupid because why would a fucking mod cause NVIDIA driver crash, it wouldn't. But... I am fucking desperate to get this fucking thing to work.
</p>

<p>
I just wish I could rage quit for good, yesterday I left laughing and today I got back like nothing happened, fucking retarded.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T12:48:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Hahahaha! loaded savegame up, hit ESC to bring mapview up and ZZZZOC, CTD. So much for the mod theory.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T13:01:00Z Did some googling about nvidia GTX TITAN X that what is the actual model of my card and is there some known issues etc.
</p>

<p>
Found that nvidia driver 347.88 would be the last good one and the CTD is caused by stressing the GPU too heavily with latest graphics games (err bad wording heh).
</p>

<p>
Also they mentioned that google chrome/firefox hardware acceleration can cause issues, well this would be easy to test by simply not running anything else than FS22.
</p>

<p>
But then someone posted: <i>"titanx here and tried the driver 347.88(using DDU) still gets tdrs fest on chorme and arma 2"</i> so doesn't appear that 347.88 fixes anything.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T13:22:00Z Installed nvidia GTX GITAN X win7-8 (heh) 347.88 drivers with clean install (never used the "DDU" thing) and now launching FS22 up in D3D_11 directx 11 mode using LOW video preset. If it now crashed then I am out of ideas and only thing left to do is to call my local computer component store and order a new GPU.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T13:26:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
But dunno if this is the same, I got these errors in the log:
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09 13:26 Error: Could not create struct buffer object.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09 13:26 Error: Could not create struct buffer SRV.
</p>

<p>
Then switched it to 1920x1080 resolution which made that stupid fucking small window in my 4k desktop, if it still crashes... then I am seriously out of ideas and going to call local computer component store right away.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T14:38:00Z Had a long break here doing some phone calls (read elsewhere, just in case this text goes to public and you forgot to clean up private info heh), but FS22 is still running, grain trailer is full and ready to be driven into railroad silo, so yeah dunno what this means, although even if this would work I would never play on 1080p small window in desktop I mean come on hehe.
</p>

<p>
But for now I'll continue playing hauling this grain and selling it off, then I need to figure out what to do.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T14:51:00Z Switched from windowed to fullscreen in options, still 1920x1080 garbage.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T14:56:00Z Shut down game as it appears the bottom GUI overloading notification disappeared after windowed and fullscreen switch. Also I want to configure firefox to disable its hardware acceleration and try to see if I can at least use firefox and 1080p low setting FS22 at the same time, because if I cant watch twitch streams while playing FS22... there is no fucking point of playing then.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T15:00:00Z Firefox disabled hardware acceleration and started my usual discord and twitch tabs there. Then launched FS22 back up to continue playing.
</p>

<p>
So a recap; 402.1k liters of soybeans in railroad silo now, in-game oct 1629hrs and starting to time accelerate for high soybeans market price.
</p>

<p>
In-game nov 2130hrs market price 3.3k goldcrest valley, but highest price should be jan 3.5k so I'm going to continue time accelerating because in 402k liters such 200 price difference makes a lot of money.
</p>

<p>
In-game jan 1907hrs soybeans goldcrest 3.7k this is now the highest I've ever seen them.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T15:35:00Z Loaded train with 300k liters of soybeans, whoah I had no idea you can fill the middle car with grains, nice.
</p>

<p>
Sold 300k soybeans for 1.110m hehe
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T16:00:00Z Sold 102k soybeans for 378.2k, budget now 1.891m.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T16:16:00Z Lunch break over, back to farming (forgot to write when went to eat). Now 1.8 million to spend and no idea how to spend it heh. Well buy farmland and equipment, but what exactly and in what ratio, I could easily spend that money to farmland and probably not even get to buy that much before it runs out. On equipment however, I could give great make over to my fleet, hmm.
</p>

<p>
For example combines, the harvest season feels like it takes forever, I would like to get another combine maybe john deere x9 with 50ft header.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and purchased farmland just to experiment, then exited without saving. This experiment was demoralizing, the amount of fields I managed to buy was THREE (3) of those larger ones, crazy.
</p>

<p>
Giants elmcreek farmland price per hectare is 60,000 so its insanely high price for a land lots.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking trying to buy a lot of land might not be the wise decision, maybe buy one field and improve equipment to speed up planting and harvest seasons, especially the harvest one.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T16:24:00Z FS22 booted back up, lets continue farming.
</p>

<p>
Our grain mill and bakery have been offline for a while now because ran out of grain, from now on I wont do all fields soybeans but dedicate few fields to oats planting just to keep these factories running and producing.
</p>

<p>
Checked giants modhub and there was a mod that I was needing real bad; optional fertilization, seeding options. Not only that but it allows direct drilling which for example lemnken solitair 12 crap wont do, excellent, going to restart game to add this mod.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T16:49:00Z Started seeding oats... except it didn't work, guess the mod doesn't work for existing vehicles, you have to buy the edited seeder, sigh.
</p>

<p>
Sold lemnken solitair 12 for 86.9k. Purchased the same with seeding options mod for 165k.
</p>

<p>
Purchased farmland with F56 on it for 266k and F57 for 372.4k, budget now 1.160m.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T17:02:00Z Started seeding oats.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T17:23:00Z Got fed up with 12m width and 15km/h slow speed so sold lemnken solitair 12 and bought amazone citan 15001-c with fertilization inactive so seed tank capacity is 7080 liters.
</p>

<p>
Because I'm not using them sold versatile 620 for 252.3k and kinze mach till 412 for 69.7k.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T17:54:00Z Finished seeding oats to F53-F57, that is enough I think.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T18:00:00Z Started herbicide spraying F53-F57.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-09T18:01:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Alright that is it, I officially give up. FS22 does not work with my GTX TITAN X, it just doesn't <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
