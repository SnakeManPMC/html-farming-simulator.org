	<h2>2023-01-05 Buying Land And Vehicle</h2>

<p>
2023-01-05T14:24:00Z New farming day has started, just woke up and did the mandatory morning computer chores, would need to cook food today but nah going to fire up Start From Zero first, will cook food when getting starving. Todays goal is to do some fertilizing contracts, buy our own vehicle and land so we can start to use autodrive, courseplay and GPS.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 12hrs 12min on it, hehe 12-12 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was really tired last night and sort of disappointed how the day ended up with contracts, I'm afraid I might have to take one of those silage baling contracts today to make some money, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
I would just like to get few fertilizing contracts to get enough money for vehicle + land.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated first day, baling contracts appeared they were all hay except the largest field which was silage and just crazy long ETA on that contract (not what better contracts said, just my own experience). Going to continue time accelerating waiting for fertilizing contracts or something I could do.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerating is done with 5000 speed which is the normal giants farmhouse sleep speed, should not be an issue but definitely when you skip YEARS it starts to make you think if the game world really is frozen in time that field stages don't have enough time to get updated between time acceleration, dunno.
</p>

<p>
When I was recently playing on <a href="pmc-undefined-farms-20km.php" target="_blank">PMC Undefined Farms 20km</a> there was no problems with fertilizing contracts, my time acceleration habits were exactly the same over there, so wonder why PMC Cereal Region 32km feels so bad now with fertilizing contracts, hmph.
</p>

<p>
Bulk of the fields are now in withered state, then there are several harvested, cultivated or plowed. However nothing seems to get seeded or fertilizing contracts, but maybe fertilizing contracts appear only after seeding like I've experience before in FS19.
</p>

<p>
Hmm wonder if fs22 has this window of opportunity for fertilizing contracts in savegame start and once the season year rolls forward those contracts disappear and the normal AI field work operations continue which bring not so many fertilizing contracts, but again as I just said about undefined farms I had no issues there, hmm so yeah maybe its just the 32.7km terrain size that field stage changes cannot keep up with 5000 speed time accelerating.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T14:47:00Z Accepted contract for seeding barley F448.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 4 big bags of seeds for 3.2k. Hopefully this contract wont take too long.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T14:53:00Z Started contract seeding barley F448, driving manually.
</p>

<p>
Seeding.
</p>

<p>
Doing good progress.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1502.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1502.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This contract, the seeding, should open fertilizing and possibly spraying contracts for this field.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T15:13:00Z Finished contract seeding barley F448, collected reward 17.3k with reimbursement for seeds 855, did not bother to drive back to the dealership for 1001 liters.
</p>

<p>
And immediately fertilizing contract appeared for F448, unfortunately it offered MANURE spreader as borrowed vehicles, hah just my luck <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took the contract and then cancelled it, refreshed contracts and the same contract appeared now with bredal spreader vehicle <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T15:16:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F448.
</p>

<p>
This now has the familiar feel, cultivating contracts opens up seeding contracts and that opens up fertilizing. Circle of life.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T15:20:00Z Started contract fertilizing F448, manually driving.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1521.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1521.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Old school fertilizing where you can see where its spread.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T15:29:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F448, collected reward 11.7k (drove the tractor to the dealership first and unloaded 4.5k liters of fertilizer).
</p>

<p>
Budget now 269.1k.
</p>

<p>
And with that its time to cook and eat food, days first meal...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:26:00Z Feeding time is over, back to contracts.
</p>

<p>
During feeding time accelerated one day, its now oct in-game 1011hrs. Was looking at better contracts ETA's and I think they don't make much sense, there are rubicon 9000 spraying ETA for 7hrs and then same size field with slurry spreader for mere 3hrs, I believe the slurry spreader is narrower boom and much much slower, so those ETAs are way off.
</p>

<p>
Decided to time accelerate 1000 speed for day or two to see if that makes any difference in field stage changes as I still feel like game world is frozen. Sure there are some changes, but... this has probably been now for a frigging DECADE of time accelerating and I haven't basically seen any fertilizing contracts, not really.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to give fs22 some time to settle down, to sync, between time accelerating through a day. But looking at how slowly field stages change in mapview, its quite scary. FS19 Seasons mod has the game sync after longer time acceleration, I feel like fs22 would need the same.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:38:00Z Accepted contract for herbicide spraying F448. This was the only spraying contract for these small fields, no fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:41:00Z Started herbicide spraying F448, contract, driving manually.
</p>

<p>
Was lucky, can CLEARLY see the weeds.
</p>

<p>
I love it.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:47:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F448, contract, collected contract reward 9.7k after driving back to the dealership and unloaded 2.2k liters of herbicide. This herbicide spraying with this berthoud bruin 4200 sprayer was extremely enjoyable <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Refreshed contracts and F448 fertilizing contract appeared with manure spreader, I accepted and cancelled it, refreshed again and now same appeared with bredal spreader <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:50:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F448.
</p>

<p>
I should probably buy my own vehicle + implement now, would be much quicker to do these fertilizing contracts when stuff would be ready to go at moments notice.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T16:54:00Z Started contract fertilizing F448, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately going from the extremely enjoyable herbicide spraying visible weeds contract, to this... blind mans bluff <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1655.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1655.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I cant tell you how much it sucks to field work blindly, it makes no sense to do it like this <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
"Finished" fertilizing the field but contract still said 90% complete, so err guess I missed a FEW spots <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T17:07:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F448, collected reward 11.7k after driving to the dealership and unloading fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 285.2k things are looking good. If I were to buy land and vehicles now, then I could do GPS or courseplay which would remove all that frustrating blind field working. That would definitely open some options, I could even think about taking one of those massive 213ha field contracts which is now out of the question because of the amount of manual (blind) driving required.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T17:26:00Z Accepted contract for seeding sunflowers F455.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 3 big bags of seeds for 2.4k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T17:28:00Z Started contract seeding sunflowers F455, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
Here we go, putting some seed into the ground.

<p>
2023-01-05T17:45:00Z Finished contract seeding sunflowers F455, collected reward 18.3k after driving to the dealership and unloading seeds, ridiculous 964 liters heh.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 300.8k, broke the three hundred thousand magical limit, whohoo (joking, there is no 300k limit hah) <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Also confirmation for Start From Zero vehicles, new holland t6.175 which has 175hp pulls bredal k165 with extensions just OK at 6k liters.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T18:13:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F455, collected reward 14.9k.
</p>

<p>
This savegames first ever contract with own land + vehicles and GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T18:18:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F153, F307, F320
</p>

<p>
Alright so these are all 216ha fields, honestly I don't plan on fertilizing all of them with bredal k165, but its just easier to locate the fields on the mapview by having all fertilizing contracts active.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 2.
</p>

<p>
I'm in luck, autodrive F324 N target is right below F307 which is one of our massive 216ha contract fields <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game after t6.175 reached the field, just in case there would be an issue with courseplay field work generation.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T18:41:00Z Started contract fertilizing F307, courseplay, ETA 4hrs 37min.
</p>

<p>
Oh man, four and a half hours <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anything for them moneyz <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Better contracts give a bit flaky estimates for data, but it shows solid fertilizer usage for this field 47.8k liters which is, hmm two refills. Lets see if that estimates is even nearly accurate.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T18:53:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F101. I mean why not.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I accepted that contract without borrowed vehicle I realized should have taken WITH borrowed vehicles and just run it with courseplay while my own tractor is doing 4hrs field work. Oh well, maybe there will be more contracts. Also I need to pay attention for solid fertilizer, I need to have money to buy that heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1857.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T1857.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Well boys and girls, today seems to be getting off to a good start, its going to be a long fertilizing contract but once that is done then we have so many more options again and as said many things can happen before this 4hrs contract is done.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T19:14:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F232, with borrowed vehicles now.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Plan now is to autodrive send this borrowed vehicle tractor to F307 to help our own tractor, I'm gonna be driving manually with GPS from the rear end of the courseplay field work course, hopefully our fertilizer is enough hehe.
</p>

<p>
Purchased one more big bag of solid fertilizer. Refilled borrowed amazone spreader 10k liters and then sent the tractor using autodrive towards F324 N target point.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T19:31:00Z Borrowed amazone spreader reached F307, now need to shuffle courseplay course to this tractor, setup GPS AB line and then we are rolling.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T19:33:00Z Started fertilizing F307 helping by manually driving using GPS from the rear end of the field work course.
</p>

<p>
Can just barely see my buddy over in the horizon <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This Start From Zero contracting now actually reminds me of <a href="../19/stories-from-zero-grande-gardens.php" target="_blank">Start From Zero PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a>, so huge fields and large scale farming. Good stuff <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh right as can be seen from the above screenshots, budget now 714. So once these fertilizer loads run out, we are in serious <i>serious</i> trouble, I honestly don't even want to think about it, my hope is that I can finish this contract with these loads.
</p>

<p>
As a fallback I have few cultivating contracts available for the new small fields if fertilizer runs out.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the stats here...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T2005.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-05T2005.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And I'm not so sure we manage to fertilize this whole field of what we got in the tanks. If I manage to finish this contract I can buy another bredal K165 setup for even more fertilizing endurance and speed.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:14:00Z Borrowed amazone spreader ran out of product, autodrive sent it back to the dealership. Our own tractor has 2k liters left and going down fast...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:22:00Z Accepted contract for cultivating F449.
</p>

<p>
Another savegame before generating courseplay field work course for cultivating contract.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:26:00Z Bredal K165 is empty and F307 fertilizing contract is only 66% complete, uh oh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:26:00Z Started cultivating F449, contract, courseplay, ETA 28min.
</p>

<p>
Then sent new holland t6.175 with bredal back to the dealership using autodrive. Nope we have no fertilizer product now but once cultivating contract finishes then we buy some <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:29:00Z And now I have to take a quick break to release PMC Cereal Region 32km v0.2.1 in <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=78&t=22814" target="_blank">PMC Cereal Region 32km Development Forum Topic</a> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

</p>

<p>
New fertilizing contract appeared on F234 which is another 216ha field and I shuffled accept/cancel until got amazone spreader for it. However no point of taking that contract yet because we don't have money for solid fertilizer. And once we finish F307 contract, then we have so much money we can do whatever we want. Most likely I'll buy another t6.175 + bredal k165 then and A LOT of fertilizer <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T20:51:00Z Finished cultivating F449, contract, collected contract reward 9.5k.
</p>

<p>
Oh wow whopping 9.5k, cant even buy eight bags of solid fertilizer, hmph. Purchased 5 big bags of solid fertilizer for 9.1k, that's all the money I had <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Refilled our bredal k165 and borrowed amazone somewhat equally, they were like tag-teaming on the solid fertilizer bags heh it was funny, then autodrive sent these tractors back to F324 N which is right next to the F307 contract field. Just a little bit more waiting, then fertilizing and we have this contract in the bag.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T21:09:00Z New holland t6.175 with bredal k165 is back fertilizing.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T21:10:00Z Borrowed amazone is back on GPS line fertilizing. Alright, lets finish this.

2023-01-05T21:23:00Z Ugh, borrowed amazone spreader just ran out of solid fertilizer and our bredal k165 will run out probably once I have typed this line of text, sending vehicles back to the dealership again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I truly cannot wait until F307 contract is done so I can buy another bredal k165 and hopefully this kind of crazy refilling is thing of the past. Or maybe its not, two bredals is about 37k liters so hmm might not be enough for 216ha field.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T21:30:00Z Accepted contract for cultivating F452.
</p>

<p>
Another save game just in case courseplay fails to generate field work course.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T21:36:00Z Started cultivating F452, contract, courseplay, ETA 57min. Oh my this lasts an hour <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay lets fire up more cultivating contracts hehe.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T21:38:00Z Accepted contract for cultivating F446. Hmm although all the remaining cultivating contracts are so large dunno if these help anything, its 57min and that is it before we get to buy solid fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
On the way, say hi to rostelmash.

<p>
John Deere all done.

<p>
2023-01-05T22:24:00Z Finished cultivating F446, contract, collected contract reward 21.9k.

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Plus four more. Refilled both spreaders tag-team style and then autodrive sent them back to F324 N target. If this load now is not enough to finish F307 fertilizing contract, then we'll have a riot.

Budget now 435.7k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Sent new holland t6.175 and borrowed amazone back to the dealership. Plenty of fertilizing contracts for 216ha fields available, but we already have few active. Now need to be careful and think ahead with solid fertilizer, these big fields eat so much product that it should never be underestimated. I would like to finish one more big fertilizing contract to get very good base budget before going crazy with multiple contracts running at the same time spreading our budget for product very thin.
</p>

<p>
A long way home ...

<p>
When tractors reached the dealership I saved game, no reason.
</p>

<pre>
- spreader 18m 18km/h 18.9k liters bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit for 88.5k
- tractor 175hp new holland t6.175 with guidancesteering 142k
</pre>

<p>
2023-01-05T23:28:00Z Purchased the above setup, now our own fertilizing setup has pretty good endurance.
</p>

<p>
Purchased iconik solid fertilizer refill station for 7.5k, placed it F442 N side. Refilled new bredal k165 with fertilizer for 30.3k. Okay now we have a base line, one bredal k165 is even 30k to refill it. Its sick that one hundred grand wont fill even four of these beasts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Refilled our first bredal for 28.1k and borrowed amazone for 13.3k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T23:42:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F96, F111, F203, F234, F271, F355, F390.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I accepted all available contracts without borrowed vehicles, I just wanted to see which one is the closest one and I do have plan on finishing them on, to make some big money. Looks like F203 is closest on, just west from the dealership, autodrive sent tractors there. Plan is the same, our two bredal k165 under courseplay and I start driving borrowed amazone using GPS from the rear end of the field work course.
</p>

<p>
Fertilizing convoy.

<p>
Hmm budget now 114.4k wonder if that is enough for solid fertilizer product for 216ha field? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game because generating big courseplay field work course.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T23:55:00Z Started contract fertilizing F203, courseplay, 2x tools, ETA 2hrs 30min. Oh geez two and a half hours <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-05T23:59:00Z Started manually GPS drive borrowed amazone spreader on F203 contract, from the courseplay field work course rear end.

<p>
Okay well this is our task for the next few hours with all the refills etc <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Mar in-game 1641hrs that late afternoon disgusting dusk is starting to appear, wont be long before we are at night time, hmm wonder if we manage to finish this field in daylight, hmm it just might be that have to time accelerate through the night.
</p>

2023-01-06T00:53:00Z Amazone back fertilizing F203, bredals are about 46% full now. Hmm wonder if three bredal k165s with extensions could do 216ha field with one tank, hmm.

2023-01-06T01:31:00Z Started contract fertilizing F448, courseplay, 2x tools, ETA 6min. Hmm this field is pretty much too small for two vehicles, but oh well I already generated the course so let them do it.

Mar in-game 1823hrs night starts to fall soon, need to skip for tomorrow so we can see. Wonder if its going to be a problem with 1 day seasons hmm, hopefully not. Apr in-game 0515hrs, good moooorning PMC Cereal Region 32km, full day of fertilizing contracts awaits <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased another new holland t6.175 and bredal k165 with extensions, plus three agco 650kg weights, budget now 225.5k. Then sent all tractors including borrowed amazone to F096 W, that field will be our next fertilizing contract target, lets get it done. Really excited to see if three bredal k165s can handle it with one tank.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T02:15:00Z Started contract fertilizing F96, courseplay, 3x tools, ETA 1hrs 42min.

<p>
2023-01-06T02:46:00Z Contract F96 is now 52% complete. Slowly getting there. Its funny how long 216ha beast of a field takes even with this many vehicles <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T02:56:00Z Borrowed amazone ran out of fertilizer, I am sending it back to the refill point of course, but hopefully the bredals would finish this contract on their own.
</p>

<p>
Oops forgot to write it down, lunch break.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T03:29:00Z Feeding time is over, back to fertilizing contracts. Tractors reached the already fertilized spot, apparently with 3 * 30m spreaders the one headland got so big that now contract is not completed until we do part of the headland, probably the center vehicle, maybe.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T03:34:00Z Okay vehicles are rolling again, contract should be done in no time.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T03:39:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F96, collected reward 407.1k. Then autodrive sent bredal tractors back to F442 N. This will be another long drive home.

<p>
2023-01-06T03:55:00Z Bredal tractors arrive to F442 N. Refilled them, budget now 524.9k.
</p>

<p>
That would be enough money to buy rubicon 9000, but that would break our nicely compatible three vehicle spreading operation and would require refilling liquid tanker, so yeah not yet, need more money. I'm going to do one more field with this setup and then we'll see how much cash we have.
</p>

<p>
Saved game, had a nice progress so lets not risk it. Then refreshed contracts and took all fertilizing ones except 2 small ones <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This might have been a bad idea, FS19 had some bugs in better contracts or the engine itself that if you accepted too many contracts then many of them started to act up by saying "you have no access to this land" or something. But its easiest way to find out which field is the closest contract. Right now its F202, right next to the dealership area, one full section field away.
</p>

<p>
Same plan as before, three bredal k165s under courseplay and I'm driving borrowed amazone spreader manually with GPS from the other side of the field work course.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T04:15:00Z Started contract fertilizing F202, courseplay, 3x tools, ETA 1hrs 42min.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T04:17:00Z Started borrowed amazone GPS driving from the other side.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T04:48:00Z Fertilizing contract F202 half way complete.
</p>

<p>
Was planning here my next move, do I buy rubicon or another bredal k165, hmm choices choices. Mack 6x4 semi-truck and liquid tanker trailer would cost roughly 160k, then optimally two rubicon 9000s on top of that, it would be somewhere around 1.2 million <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Right now this 3 * bredal k165 + borrowed amazone setup is nice as it covers full section 216ha field, no refills needed. So its just pick and choose which contract to do, one by one, racking up those 400k rewards. Of course having more spreading power never hurts.
</p>

<p>
Almost dry.
</p>

<p>
Bredal spreaders were getting low on fertilizer, about 35% left, but F203 was right next to their position and why not start doing that contract now and go refill later, save one trip.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T05:29:00Z Started contract fertilizing F203, courseplay, 3x tools, ETA 1hrs 38min.

2023-01-06T05:41:00Z Started borrowed amazone fertilizing F203 from the rear direction.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-06T0542.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Cereal-Region-32km-2023-01-06T0542.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Cereal Region 32km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Had to shuffle some courseplay bredal spreaders while my GPS amazone was waiting, courseplay decided to stop the center and right side vehicles for some collision reason (there was none). Anyways sorted it out. <i>Edit: 2024-02-20 this is the earliest mentioning in this story about courseplay-gui garbage "3+ vehicles end of headland left the course bug". This bug became my arch nemesis along the several Start From Zero savegames in winter 2023.</i>
</p>

<p>
Because this three bredal k165s most likely cant finish one 216ha field alone I would really like to buy fourth one to bring it into nice round number of vehicles and massive endurance guaranteed to do 216ha field in one go. Maybe I'll get that after this contract is done.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:12:00Z First bredal k165 ran out of fertilizer, I'm lazy and wait until they are all out, then send all of them back to F442 N for a refill.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:20:00Z Bredal's sent to refill.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:28:00Z All bredals refilled, budget now 823.7k. Next sent them back to F203.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that I need to buy the fourth bredal spreader and then always do one courseplay field work course at one go. It is just the simplest and easiest way to handle fertilizing contract on a huge field. Of course this fails if vehicles collide with each other due bad course generation, but there is not much you can do about it, by increasing convoy distance to next vehicle it could prevent some turn collisions, maybe.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:30:00Z Borrowed amazone spreader is empty, sending tractor to F442 N.
</p>

<p>
I am more and more thinking about rubicon 9000 sprayer, mack 6x4 semi-truck and utts-32000 liquid tanker. If I also bought utts-32000 with "solids" config I could haul fertilizer and seeds using it, not sure if the semi-truck would get a bit busy with two tankers, but hmm dunno.
</p>

<p>
One thing I do realize that this is kind of short term planning, once this YEAR is over and fertilizing contracts done... then you have farm yard full of fertilizing equipment and nothing to fertilize heh. A proper long term plan would be to buy land, seeder and harvester, then start to work on your own fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:38:00Z First bredal is fertilizing again, will take some time to get the numer 2 and 3 back on the course.
</p>

<p>
Refilled borrowed amazone, then send it back to F203 N although not sure if there is still time to help.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:51:00Z Borrowed amazone back in spreading.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Actually that farming of our own fields start to feel quite tempting again now... well, first time in this savegame of course, but yeah. I already have more than capable fertilizer spreading setup so only thing would be the bare essential minimum seeder and harvester.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-06T06:54:00Z Alarm went off that I've been awake for 17hrs straight (playing PMC Cereal Region 32km Start From Zero test savegame heh). I'm not tired at all, I'll keep going <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was looking at farmland available lands, there were four of those full section 216ha fields for about 2 million each, then of course those small starter fields which include several grass fields too, those I would always want to keep kind of like reserve, but then again right now I have fully capable fertilizing fleet to take on these 216ha fields like its nothing so I have no reason to save those small fields for contracts, why would I even do small fields when I can do these huge ones.
</p>
