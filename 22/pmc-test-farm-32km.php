A very bad big map, with big square boring fields <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This terrain was not meant for playing as its a simply testing version for 32.7km x 32.7km terrain size, however it sort of developed on itself into quite nice big map with basic functionality. I find these completely square identical size fields extremely boring, but maybe someone who really likes LARGE HUGE fields farming finds some enjoyment from this terrain, thats why it got released. I really wish to have put some more irregular shapes and sizes of fields in, but oh well.
</p>

<p>
This is empty object-less terrain, there are no buildings, no trees and no selling points. Heightmap is nice smooth rolling hills type elevations. There are crazy number of square fields all the same size except on east and south edges, these fields have proper field definitions so contracts will work just fine as can be seen from screenshots.
</p>

<p>
There is a vehicle shop triggers only (no 3D building), no vehicle repair trigger either. Farmland image is ... well there is some detail, I believe 36 individual land lot areas to purchase, but these are mostly 3000 hectares a piece costing whopping 29 million in average, so better save some money heh.

<p>
PMC Test Farm 32km is absolutely megalodon gigantic size terrain, our previous historical high score terrain size was <a href="../19/pmc-eternal-sugar-beet-damnation-32km.php">PMC Eternal Sugar Beet Damnation 32km (FS19)</a> which did not work very well with low density image resolutions. Now FS22 has multi core and multi thread (file handling I believe) support which allow us to run huge density images and multiple vehicles (tested 4 hired workers so far) at the same time without any freezes or even stutter. What was a mere joke in FS19 is now pretty much the largest possible maybe even playable terrain in FS22. And that farmers, is a very good news <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

	<h2>Fields</h2>

<p>
Fields smallest: 38.9 ha, largest 213.4 ha.
</p>

<p>
Please note that most of the 441 fields are 213ha in size, all boring identical squares, only the east and south terrain edge fields are smaller but that is only because they are sort of cut off by the terrain edge.

For installing please read <a href="../19/install-mods.php">how to install FS19 mods</a> and <a href="../19/install-pmc-terrain-mods.php">how to install PMC terrain mods</a>. Yes these FS19 tutorials still work with FS22 with the obvious "19" versus "22" changes.
