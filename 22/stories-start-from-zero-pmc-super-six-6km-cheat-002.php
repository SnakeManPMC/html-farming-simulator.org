	<h2>2022-09-22 Fertilizing Contracts Underway</h2>

<p>
2022-09-22T13:30:00Z New farming day has started, this savegame now has 9hrs 12min on it.
</p>

<p>
Just woke up and finished morning computer chores, have not eaten days first meal yet, gotta get into farming first. Installed giants DLCs which came with the one year pass, kubota and some others, also the free AGI pack which required registration and activation heh.
</p>

<p>
Situation report from yesterday, its sep in-game 1747hrs and buget is 163.7k with plenty of lucrative contracts available.
</p>

<p>
Decided that why not, lets check out how good the giants suggested in-game "packs - grain" would work for me, so started to buy those equipment (except combine header trailer) until I have no more money left.
</p>

<p>
Purchased deutz fahr topliner 4090 hts with guidancesteering for 144.5k ... and thats it, already out of money, ouch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So need to take another fertilizing contract. Accepted contract fertilizing F01.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Refilled this into borrowed massey ferguson and bredal k165 spreader.
</p>

<p>
Drove outline for F01 recording courseplay course, then generated field work course... and thats when I realized the borrowed bredal k165 does not have 6m spreading unit, so now my tools widths are 24m and 30m, sigh. Oh well what can you do, generated course with 24m width so will be losing a lot of product.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T13:52:00Z Started contract fertilizing F01, courseplay, 2x tools.
</p>

<p>
And now that courseplay is running two spreaders, its my time to grab days first meal <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T14:21:00Z Feeding time is over, back to watching a long courseplay field work course running...
</p>

<p>
Sep in-game 1846hrs night is falling quick and considering the size of this field, our bredal spreaders are running very low on solid fertilizer, my budget is 3.7k so there is not much I can do. If I really run out of fertilizer then I have to sell the combine I just bought and buy more fertilizer. That would be messy but well what other option is there.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should have given a bit more thought to this contract, the field size. But hey, who knows maybe the fertilizer lasts.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T14:56:00Z That's it, the lead vehicle, contract borrowed massey ferguson with bredal k165 without extensions just ran out of solid fertilizer and contract is just 53% complete. Uh oh.
</p>

<p>
I got 4k liters in the second vehicle (our own fendt 500 favorit) so going to link these vehicles up and balance the remaining fertilizer as 2k/2k, lets see how far I would get with that load.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:01:00Z And I continue with 2k/2k fertilizer setup. This will run out I'm sure of it, but lets worry about when that actually happens...
</p>

<p>
Purchased 2 * big bag of solid fertilizer for 3.6k, budget now whopping 104, hoho.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:13:00Z Fendt 500 favorit just ran out of fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:14:00Z Massey ferguson ran out of fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Had to sell deutz-fahr topliner 4090h combine so I can buy fertilizer, she went for 115.6k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k times THREE, budget now 72k. Topped up borrowed bredal k165 to 100% full 15.6k liters.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:20:00Z Borrowed massey ferguson is back on spreading fertilizer, driving our fendt 500 favorite for a topup now.
</p>

<p>
Refilling in the darkness.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T1521.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T1521.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:24:00Z Fendt 500 favorit is back fertilizing, now I get to finish this field as both bredals are full, but man what a cluster fuck this contract was in the darkness in too tall corn, uuh, lets not repeat something like this ever again, never accept contract if you do not have the product to finish it.
</p>

<p>
Spread it.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T1535.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T1535.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-22T15:58:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F01, drove massey ferguson to the dealership, unloaded bredal k165, collected reward 328.8k.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and time accelerated until morning daylight, oct in-game 0723hrs.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T16:06:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F08.
</p>

<p>
This field was already fertilized previously so I had autodrive route there, was so nice to just send tractor while I ALT-TABbed to write this text heh. Yeah I still don't have my own land so technically I'm cheating according to the original old school FS17 Cornbelt From Scratch rules <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: and here you are, just smiling and joking about it. Cheating scumbags like you should be shot and the bodies burned...</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T16:09:00Z Purchased field 11 for 8.4k just on principle so I don't have to consider myself a cheater <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: ooh and THAT makes it alright, retroactively buy the farmland like it would make it alright, haha what a fucking bitch ass loser.</i>
</p>

<p>
There you have it, not exactly the spectacle fanfare I was hoping for when buying your first own field, but hey technically I'm now abiding by the Start From Zero rules, so there is no guilt while using autodrive, courseplay or GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: in disbelief, quietly shaking my head...</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T16:15:00Z Started contract fertilizing F08, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T16:37:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F08, collected reward 43.9k.
</p>

<p>
Drove fendt 500 favorit to the dealership and topped up bredal k105. Now I have no more fertilizing contracts on the board.
</p>

<pre>
- combine 8.2k liters deutz fahr topliner 4090 hts with guidancesteering 144.5k
- header 6m deutz fahr topliner 4090 header 30k
- trailer 8k liters welger dk 115 no cover 11.5k
- seeder 125hp 3m 600 liters nordsten hk 25 + ns 3030 33.5k
===
219.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased above list, budget now 197.1k. Then started to drive this small starter kit vehicle fleet to my F11 in SE. Reached F11 and parked small seeder to the farm yard next to it, then send tractor back, at the same time send deutz fahr topliner combine towards F11.
</p>

<p>
Topliner is hilariously slow with 20km/h speed <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its now oct in-game 0831hrs so barley and wheat planting season, hmm those are not really money makers and if doing them now then I'll miss soybeans planting season next year, so yeah I'll pass especially as I don't have any seed production etc where wheat would actually be needed.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T17:28:00Z Slept only 5hrs last night, now yawning constantly with eyes watering, cant stay awake, its nap time. Also when I get up I can update courseplay, better contracts etc all github mods that I forgot earlier today.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T21:35:00Z Nap is over, on editing computer downloaded new versions and couple of new mods, put them in PMC Linux server, now fired up Gaming computer, updated win10 garbage, setup the new mods with symlinks and right now FS22 savegames 7-zip backup batch file is running, gotta have them backups just in case something breaks.
</p>

<p>
I actually forgot to add the giants savegame backup dir deletion to that bat and now its size is whopping 4.4gb yikes, oh well.
</p>

<p>
Anyways now all PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.3 autodrive, courseplay and guidancesteering XML files are saved in backup, no work is lost.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T21:41:00Z FS22 and savegame loaded up, lets continue farming <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sending fendt 500 favorit to the dealership, I need to buy seeds for the next years soybean planting season and to haul them, hmm guess the basic strautmann autoloading trailer.
</p>

<pre>
- trailer strautmann sek 802 pallet autoloader configuration pallets extreme 9k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above. I recall using it back in december 2021 on my elmcreek new farmer savegame to haul seed pallets, so I've done this before, I think heh. Well now I get to use the new version of this autoloading pallet trailer. Once our business grows bigger I need to buy a semi-truck and one of those big trailers, or dunno if they were pulled by tractors cant remember, actually have to download some new mod for it, hmm. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of seeds for 6.4k times two.
</p>

<p>
All loaded up <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2152.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2152.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
While doing this autoloading trailer seed hustle, two small to medium size fertilizing contracts appeared, those might be doable before time accelerating towards soybeans planting season, hmm, but I'll just time accelerate because I have done enough contracts for a while now, its time to start working my own ground, finally.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of our own ground, that F11 is quite small, but hopefully its nice to work on with these vehicles I have, once first harvest is done then I get to say how boring / lame was it to play small time farmer, I'm not even thinking about upgrading anything until I do the one full harvest with these small vehicles, equipment and land.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T21:59:00Z Our tiny seeder is refilled with seeds and parked next to F11, now just time accelerating until I get to soybeans planting season. Sure I'll check contracts and dealership sales every day just to not miss anything, but I really don't plan on doing anymore contracts before soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Jan in-game 0946hrs bredal K165 was on sale for -49% off, it was tempting but passed as I really don't need one right now and besides, don't even have second tractor to pull it.
</p>

<p>
Many cultivating contracts this month.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0948hrs spring contracts appeared, fertilizing, seeding and one spraying contract too.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0933hrs soybeans planting season is here, finally I get to plant my OWN FIELD! whohoo <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T22:12:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Seeding, baby! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2214.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2214.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This F11 was odd, it allowed me to seed on the GRASS outside the field so grass disappeared and field appeared, huh?
</p>

<p>
This is fun, seeding with a tiny seeder and tractor heh. You gotta do your first field seeding manually with GPS to be one with the soil. But yeah make no mistake, this will take a while. In the future I'll let courseplay run this while I go do contracts.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2218.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2218.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-22T22:22:00Z Actually this field doesn't take as long as I was afraid off, about half way done now, going pretty good.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T22:38:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11. That went much faster than I expected, nice.
</p>

<p>
There you have it, our very first own field seeded with soybeans using GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2239.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2239.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And with that, its time to cook first batch of food for today and also eat, this will take a while, maybe I'll time accelerate some between cooking and eating phases but probably not going to be any real progress to this savegame.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T23:09:00Z First phase is over and I have few minutes, realized that hey, our field needs fertilizer and I have a big whopping solid fertilizer spreader right next to it, so lets spread some <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T23:11:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T23:14:00Z Finished fertilizer F11, center of the field is now 100% fertilized, on the edges there are some spots which are not.
</p>

<p>
Then time accelerated to oct in-game 0940hrs, F11 soybeans is now ready to harvest. I'm good to go as soon as I get done eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T23:55:00Z Cooking and feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Additional field info shows potential harvest quantity 4252 liters and potential yield 5.51t/ha. Wow that is ridiculously small amount hehe.
</p>

<p>
Decided to do this first harvest driving combine manually with GPS, doing headland or two first.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T23:57:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
Some in-cab action.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2359.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T2359.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0002.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0002.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Great to be back harvesting your own field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This field was seeded and not cared for in any way except the "why not" fertilizing, there was weeds growing and all that, but it didn't bother me at all, I was just happy to harvest my own field.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T00:09:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F11. Total soybeans yield was 6549 liters.
</p>

<p>
Whee our first own harvested field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0011.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Then set "sell price trigger" mod to monitor soybeans prices, it will alert me when it rises above 3714 which is -100 from the highest recorded in this savegame.
</p>

<p>
And then was the hard part again; to decide what to do next <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
We have bunch of fertilizing contracts where one offers bredal k165 spreader but unless the icon is accurate that it doesnt have 6m spreading unit, I have no idea which setup do they give, so having two tractors on the field may not be possible.
</p>

<p>
Another thought about contracts is that if I want to grow my "contract company", next I would have to buy two tractors and bredal k165's with extensions and 6m spreading units, that would be a good start. Once money grows to half a million then buying a rubicon 9000, after that second one. At that point my money flow would probably be pretty good and I would only be limited by amount of fertilizing contracts available.
</p>

<p>
After that it would be combine harvesting fleet, so big combine or two, grain cart with tractor and semi-truck with grain trailer.
</p>

<p>
If I'll fantasize more, then after that would be a good baling fleet and I don't even know what kind of equipment such would include. Baling, fertilizing and harvesting fleets would make so much contract money its not even funny.
</p>

<p>
But yeah, still the focus should be to grow our own farm, land and these small equipment.
</p>

<p>
I am going to do one more of these small F11 field harvests with these equipment, just not to bunny hop into the next best thing right away. It would be matter of hours to generate enough revenue from contracts to upgrade our current fleet, maybe even buy another field. But I'm not going to do that, doing contracts is fine but next year I'll plant soybeans again with same equipment.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T00:22:00Z I didn't know what to... so lets time accelerate to that next soybeans planting season. And who knows, maybe the soybeans best selling day comes along the way too, I got that welger trailer "full" of soybeans just waiting to go.
</p>

<p>
Demco 2200 grain cart is on sale -56% off, umm nice, should I take it... I absolutely don't need it but... but ... heh no idea <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decisions maan, they are so HARD! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
hehe
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong, when I'm know what I'm doing making decisions is so fucking easy, you do the right thing always, whats the confusion, get it done. But these kind of dumb small things like what to do in farmsim savegame next is like huge dilemmas for me haha <img src="../images/smileys/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Smiley :rolleyes:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Maybe that rant got me fired up but...
</p>

<pre>
- grain cart 77.5k liters demco 2200 dual auger grain cart 49.6k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above from -56% sale, budget now 125.7k.
</p>

<p>
I have to say some of those contracts are really tempting, but nope, lets keep time accelerating until I get to plant some soybeans again.
</p>

<p>
February snow. Winter is cool, no pun intended.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0036.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0036.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Kubota XMS218 sprayer was on sale for -63% off which is a lot, well as its so cheap I just gotta have it hehe. It will allow our farm to get rid of weeds. Kubota XMS218 was on sale for 9.7k but I took some extra options for it like working width 28m and capacity XL, so price went up to 27.1k.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0908hrs spring has arrived, fertilizing and seeding contracts available even though there is snow on the ground (which disappeared while I was writing this paragraph heh).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:01:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS. Just driving manually as its so quick job, probably would take longer to setup courseplay than to drive it myself, this is two passes and done hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:02:00Z Finished fertilizing F11. Told ya.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:04:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0105.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0105.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:27:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
It was fun little task, just about the right duration, not too short and not too long, just right. Looks like 23 minutes.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:30:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:32:00Z Finished fertilizer F11.
</p>

<p>
Picked up strautmann sek 802 autoloading trailer and sent tractor to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
Purchased a herbicide tank for 2.4k times four. Then refilled kubota xms218 to 7.5k 100% full.
</p>

<p>
Previously I read somewhere that weeds in FS22 work so that you can herbicide spray them right after seeding to prevent any growth or damage to the seeded crop which obviously is not growing yet. I am going to try that now. What better place to try than tiny 0.5ha F11. <i>Edit: not sure if it was just a typo or mishap, but its nothing to do with FS22, seasons weeds worked like this already in FS19. Seed and then herbicide spray, done.</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:49:00Z Started herbicide spraying F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Well this is bizarre, spraying herbicide on top of fertilizer... makes field look more dry? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0150.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0150.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-23T01:52:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F11. Now its interesting to see if any weeds grow.
</p>

<p>
Okay next is time accelerating until soybeans highest market price day comes, because thats whats going to happen before october when I get to harvest this season.
</p>

<p>
I love how my field is growing, new life is coming up. Heh well plant life haha.
</p>

<p>
As I've said <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/" target="_blank">ArmA 3</a> is all about death and destruction but farmsim games are all about creating new life, in the form of plant life. I love the balance my life has with these two game types.
</p>

<p>
BTW was thinking that I'm going to test, edit and fix all FS22 PMC terrains to be Start From Zero compatible. Yes even the monster <a href="pmc-korkscrew-40km.php">PMC Korkscrew 40km</a> etc which are really not suitable for legit Start From Zero savegames. Wrote a todo entry about it, lets see if someday I get around to do that. It actually would be fun to test it out, launch these megalodon monster terrains and try to get from zero going, obviously not finishing the savegame but play a bit to see how it works.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0958hrs soybeans are growing and yield-bonus currently is 95% which is very nice, it says needs rolling but that is because the stupid fucking game feature cannot be turned off. Also lime and plowing is disabled as options so that might help. <i>Edit: there is now a mod for it in <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=271962" target="_blank">giants modhub: FS22 No Need To Roll</a></i>
</p>

<p>
At in-game 1421hrs soybeans market price alert came up, its now 3788. I honestly cannot remember how much is the max in FS22, but I'm hoping it would be at least 4k, but I might confuse the numbers as I just read FS17 Cornbelt From Scratch which was talking so much about the prices heh.
</p>

<p>
At in-game 1844hrs its 3872. At 2341hrs its unfortunately dropping 3861 now. Jul in-game 0327hrs its 3776 and dropping, ouch I missed the best selling price. Okay time to go haul our grain trailer to PMC Sell 02 selling point.
</p>

<p>
So to recap our soybean grain trailer has 6549 liters, market price is now 3772.
</p>

<p>
Got 24.7k from the grain, not too bad from such a small field with weeds on it.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0946hrs soybeans F11 is ready to harvest. Yield-bonus stays 95% and there is no weeds, so pre-eventive herbicide spraying right after seeding takes care of weeds. Not sure if spraying fertilizer would mess up that field stage thing for herbicide that you would spray but it had no effect as it would "not stick" to the field.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, lets start harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T02:47:00Z Started harvsting soybeans F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Its somehow relaxing to combine using in-cab view.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:01:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F11. Yield was 7241 liters now with weeds taken care of and 100% fertilization.
</p>

<p>
Unloadin'...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0302.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0302.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:05:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:07:00Z Finished fertilizer F11.
</p>

<p>
So now I have done two full legit own field soybeans harvest with tiny equipment, I'm going to do few fertilizing contracts to get some more money while I'm figuring out what to do (buy) next.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:10:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F22.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Refilled borrowed bredal k165 without spreading units.
</p>

<p>
Drove to F22 and courseplay recorded field definition outline for this field.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:23:00Z Started contract fertilizing F22, courseplay.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0325.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0325.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:28:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F21.
</p>

<p>
Going to do F21 with my own equipment, fendt 500 favorit and bredal k105 with 6m spreading unit.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:34:00Z Purchased diesel fuel buying station placeable for 2.5k, put it to the dealership yard.
</p>

<p>
Refilled fendt 500 favorit, she was running low on diesel. Drove to F21 and courseplay recorded field definition outline for it.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T03:44:00Z Started contract fertilizing F21, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Our own fendt 500 favorit on the horizon.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0345.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-23T0345.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-23T04:17:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F22, then sent tractor to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T04:22:00Z Unloaded solid fertilizer from borrowed bredal k165 then F22 contract collected reward 81.2k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T04:31:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F21, collected reward 101.6k.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and sent tractor to the dealership, now I'm off to cook second batch of food...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:18:00Z Cooking and feeding time is over.
</p>

<p>
Better contracts seems to give high number of fertilizing contracts where borrowed vehicles are slurry spreaders, for example I have seen in today's farming session rubicon 9000 ONE time only and I think even that was for herbicide spraying contract. I don't like this development in better contracts mod, at all. Previous versions months ago were great where you always waited not too long time to get rubicon 9000 and then took bunch of fertilizing or spraying contracts to do with that vehicle, now... its almost impossible as every other contract is manure or slurry spreader, which are the worst fertilizing methods.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0957hrs, soybeans planting season is here again, going to do one more planting but this time using courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay generated pretty funky looking field work course for F11, hmm very very wide almost to the road, interesting.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:37:00Z Started seeding soybeans F11, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:43:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F24.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k times two.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:50:00Z Started contract fertilizing F24, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Two vehicles now running, one for my own land and one contract, nice. I kind of feel today at this point of farming that I got that tiny small vehicle and field process out of my system and now I need to make some serious money again to take our farm step further.
</p>

<p>
This would mean expanding our combine, seeder and land. Two grass fields next to F11 are quite affordable, but bigger equipment requires bigger tractor too, so that might be a bit more problematic. I haven't even started to scope out what kind of upgrade would it be.
</p>

<p>
I cant expand land only with this current 3m seeder that's for sure.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:54:00Z Fendt 500 favorit under courseplay did something odd, it was stopped by the road when I checked upon it, very odd.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T05:55:00Z Yeah courseplay fucked it up, I could not make it continue so I have to take over manually with GPS, this sucks <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Contract borrowed tractor running fertilizer elsewhere of course is good, so I don't just drive manually with GPS all by myself, meaning money wise, cash register is clinging constantly as I'm GPS driving here.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:10:00Z Was making plans of purchasing solid fertilizer fleet upgrade, two bredal k165's with extensions and 6m spreading units would cost 177k, then I would need at least one more tractor preferrably two. I don't even know for sure what horsepower tractor is required for k165 hmm, in <a href="../19/stories.php">PMC Iowa Garden City 8km Start From Zero (unofficial dunno which number)</a> I used fendt 939 vario which pulled it great, but I think it was too powerful.
</p>

<p>
In FS22 fendt 939 vario is 385hp. Dunno but it sounds awfully lot. It would cost 341.5k which definitely is too much for me now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:22:00Z Finished seeding soybeans F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:22:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F24, sent tractor to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:24:00Z Contract F24 collected reward 45.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:26:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:28:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:29:00Z Started herbicide spraying F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:31:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F11.
</p>

<p>
Alright another soybeans planting season is done, yield-bonus 95% and unless something odd happens that will stay. There are those same hay baling and fertilizing contracts, but I am not feeling up to taking them now, so going to just time accelerate until soybeans highest market price day comes and after that soybeans harvest season again.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 2322hrs soybeans market price is 3837 at PMC Sell 04, going to take our last years crop there now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:47:00Z Sold 7241 liters of soybeans with 3845 market price for 27.7k, budget now 317.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T06:58:00Z Autodrive drove the tractor back to F11, saved game and a haircut, shave and shower sounds pretty good right about now.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:23:00Z Back. Continued to time accelerate, check contracts and dealership sales. There is some good money on those harvest contracts, but man as they take several hours to finish.
</p>

<p>
Got a good sale -43% off from bratner trailer, more capacity, decided to purchase it.
</p>

<pre>
- trailer 18.5k liters brantner z 18051/2 xxl power flex 13.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:31:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F11, courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Fendt 500 favorit picked up brantner trailer from the dealership. Its not needed as grain cart as the whole F11 yield fits to combines grain tank, but its good to have larger trailer ready when I purchase our next field.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:51:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F11. Had to cleanup few spots courseplay missed, courseplay is a crude bulk tool.
</p>

<p>
Final yield was 7250 liters.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:54:00Z Started fertilizing F11, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:55:00Z Finished fertilizing F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-23T07:56:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, time to call it a night. Starting to get a bit tired and because of nap earlier today I'm not even sure what time is my bed time, farming gets harder and harded by each moment when you get more tired, its not very enjoyable to play like that, so better to call it.
</p>

<p>
Today was pretty good day, got some good contracts done and three (was it three?) own field soybean harvests done.
</p>
