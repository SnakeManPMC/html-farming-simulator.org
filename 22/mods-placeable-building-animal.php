	<h2>Beef Shed</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by westernIowa. From modDesc: Barn to raise beef cattle.
</p>

<p>
FS22_cowShed.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: 2023-09-14T18:09:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. Cow shed, cow barn, cattle barn. Three different colored cow barns. Price $100,000. Animals capacity 500. maxNumVisualAnimals="80". Bizarre fence which is made of road guard-rails, its hard to see through it looking at the animals, you have to jump into the fence to get a clear view, very weird, maybe american cattle barns are done this way but feels very odd. Visually I can only see eight (8) animals... could it be that giants default is some low number and here westernIowa has configured it to 80 so giants just uses the first number from it, dunno just speculating. Anyways this is a very nice looking american farming cattle feedlot of sorts, cattle barn, its larger and american so much better than giants german default cown barn big. Saw some comments online that this cattle barn has no animal LOADING trigger (take cattle out of the barn), only the unloading trigger, not sure if that is true or not. Barn placeable accepts straw: 223,529 liters and forage (TMR): 352,941 liters. This placeable do not show the additional info box in bottom right corner of the screen when you walk up to it, the same way giants hormann cow and big barns do. I just cannot stand that fence made out of road guard-rail where you cannot see the animals in full view. Liquidmanure extensions did not register this beef shed placeable same as they do giants hormann cow barn big. Animals feeding animation position does not reach the feeding trough, they come about 2m short. Worth to note that the title says "beef shed" so there is no milk capacity or trigger, this placeable generates no milk so don't bother putting dairy cows in this one.

<b>Special note:</b> please be aware that "cowshed" by MISSYB has duplicate file name, so if you download <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=255163" target="_blank">Cow Barn With Pasture by MISSYB</a> from giants modhub and copy it to your mod-set dir, it will overwrite WesternIowa's beef cattle shed.

	<h2>Hog Confinement</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Western Iowa. From modDesc: Capacity: 2400 pigs, Daily upkeep: 48 $/day, Opening gates. Additional manure storage can be purchased separately.
</p>

<p>
FS22_hogBarn.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: 2023-09-14T18:31:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. Spaces in file names. Price $250,000. A very long large pig barn, color options red and white. Food loading trigger is on TOP of a small silo, you need and special trailer to "feed the silo". This pig barn has no outside area for pigs to walk around. Inside the building there are STATIC pig 3d models frozen in time. When you buy animals by default giants setup only allows to purchase 60 animals at one buy, it takes forever to buy full 2400 heads but guess the idea is only buy max half of that amount and breed the pigs. Once animals are bought in, then normal 3D animated pig animal models appear walking inside the barn among the statis 3D animal models, looks very bad, therefore this is purely "numbers only" massive pig breeding for profit operation building without any of the nice animated animals walking outside type pasture. Nothing wrong with that numbers only method, just know what you're getting into, you see no pigs on this building when standing outside. Pig barns accept food 200,000 liters and internal slurry capacity 4 million liters. Liquidmanure extensions work but manure heap extension do not, if you place manure heap next to this hog barn it will not connect to it. Additional info box for this animal barn has very limited trigger, on the food bin side of the barn the trigger in fact is too short, you have to "kiss the wall" in order to activate it, on the other end of the barn its way out (like it should be), on the long sides its not present, ie the trigger is too small and positioned incorrectly. Food refilling trigger is indeed on top of the food bins which is realistic sure, but absolutely makes refilling food to this barn a nightmare, auger pipe meridian TL12-39 works OK. With 1200 pigs time accelerating one day (a month) will consume about 38% of the food capacity, time accelerating another month and pig barn was 26% food left. Animal dialog comes up OK when using animal transport trailer. Slurry can be picked up from the trailer loading icon.

Notes: 2023-10-12T21:56:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. Very nice selectable colors (even without ThundR's addon). American looking animal building. Info box (bottom right corner of the screen) comes up nicely with animal statistics for animals and food. Has clear easy to see and operate grain trailer dump grate trigger on the long side of the building. Has office room in the building where animal buy trigger is located. As the description mention 5000 chickens and feed capacity 500,000 liters which is very nice. However... there are NO CHICKENS to be seen in this building, none, zero, nada, zip. No chickens at all, they are all virtual chickens in placeables.xml under animal husbandries, if you want to see your nice chickens then this coop / barn / building is not for you. This building is a massive chicken breeding farm. If you want to produce a lot of eggs, the egg pallets spawn in SHELVES INSIDE the building with 180 degree turn so you cannot back up an autoloading trailer here even if you wanted to, this renders this building completely useless for egg production, there is not a player on this planet who would want to skid steer load egg pallets from this kind of 180 degree corner location room into a trailer etc when you have five thousand (5000) chickens, not a single one. Such a shame waste of time and effort to make this building as its so useless, sure you could use this as chicken breeding house, but you would have to transfer all those chickens from building to building by saving game, exiting, then editing placeables.xml with an text editor before launching FS22 with the savegame back up again, some people might say that is cheating and its a point of view question if they are wrong or right, what is a fact is that its quite bit of work and almost impossible in multiplayer farming sessions. So yeah, very nice building on paper, has almost zero game-play worth :(

	<h2>Eight Bay Double Cow Shed</h2>

<p>
v1.0 by Sully. From modDesc: Eight bay Double cow shed: - Price: 200000$. - Dailyupkeep: 20$. - Capacity: 200 cows. - Dimensions: 35.6 m x 39.6 m. - Height: 9.5m. - 6 Sliding doors at each side. - Manure spawns in the shed. - Light swtich. - Automatic water. - Colour configurations. - Slurry fill point. - Slatted tank.

<p>
FS22_8BayCowshed.zip
</p>

<p>
Notes: 2024-05-19T00:14:00Z tested, no errors, no issues. Capacity: food 140k liters, milk 75k liters, straw 40k liters, slurry 150k liters and manure 30k liters. This is general looking cow barn/shed, perhaps more european looking than anything else. Has several doors on both ends of the building. In-game 3D looks pretty nice actually, whith all the doors opened it feels "wide and open", can fit new holland t8.435 genesis with wide tires through, also the biggest giants forage wagon bergmann htw 65 fits just barely under the door, although the forage/food content 3d model does clip through the doors roof but I can live with that. Cows will walk around inside but not on the center line where you drive tractor through. Hmm I feel like food, especially milk capacity is a bit low, might become a grind to have few of these cow barns in your farm. Overall this is a nice cow shed, I might consider using it 3D model wise, just not sure about the capacity.
