	<h2>2022-04-21 Sunflower Harvest Contract</h2>

<p>
2022-04-21T00:57:34Z Decided to TRY playing Start From Zero in PMC Super Six 6km. Copied the terrain release to PMC mods dir and launched fs22.
</p>

<p>
When started new career and chose farm-manager game-mode, was really disappointed to see new farmer vehicles in there. They are not supposed to be in this game-mode <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not only that fs22 itself was 16FPS with game.xml view distance settings. PMC Gaming computer runs GTX 1060 3gb video card now because my nvidia GTX TITAN X is faulty and crashes nvidia drivers on fs22.
</p>

<p>
So had to revert back to the stock default fs22 video preset LOW setting without the view distance game.xml settings <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Looks like crap but nothing beats 60FPS, I'm not watching a screenshot slide show here, I'm playing a game.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T01:11:17Z Reset savegame xml files to 0 everything, then launched fs22 back up again.
</p>

<p>
In-game FPS was still frigging 30FPS, huh what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways lets get started. In contracts menu using better contracts, there was only 4 contracts available and only one of them which could be done without any product, with 0 budget, that was plowing F02 with estimate time of SIX HOURS, haha yeah no thanks.
</p>

<p>
Unless I'm mistaken PMC Super six 6km does not have any grass fields, there are 6 fields total and none of them are grass. I believe this is why contracts have very limited offerings.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated skipping a day to see if new contracts appear, but I kind of doubt it with only six fields.
</p>

<p>
One potato harvesting contract for F05 appeared, with estimated time of 26hrs <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Skipped another day, now F05 has cultivating contract with estimated time of 3hrs 50min, still hard no for that heh.
</p>

<p>
Better contracts mod for fs22 is quite excellent, you can now filter out all contracts which require money for example (fertilizing, sowing and spraying).
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T01:31:16Z Sunflower harvest contract appeared for F06, estimated time 2hrs 36min and reward 52.3k hmm hmm. That is quite tempting, even though it is fairly long harvest.
</p>

<p>
Decided to give it a try, its not end of the world I don't have to finish it, but either its that or more boring time accelerating. My motivation to play FS22 is quite low, my mind keeps drifting to ArmA 3 mission editing more and more by every passing minute.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T01:34:14Z Accepted harvest contract F06 for 52.3k reward.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T01:53:37Z Started harvesting F06 contract.
</p>

<p>
First pass with combine was fine, but when I turned back to heading 77 degrees, performance dropped to 23FPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It was just painful to watch the stuttering screen. You could just tell even without FPS indicator how awful the performance was.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T02:05:32Z Did the first combine unload to semi-truck. Decision was pretty much made, I'm going back to ArmA 3 editing. In my mind I was already planning what and how to edit.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T02:22:16Z Saved game and exited fs22, I am done playing this for now, back to ArmA 3 editing.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T08:12:07Z Back at PMC Gaming computer, did some good ArmA 3 edits, then started long heavy processes running there and now decided to come continue a bit more PMC Super Six 6km farming <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Just a re-cap, this is me manually driving combine and semi-truck, no courseplay no GPS.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T08:33:49Z Dumped one semi-truck load of canola into PMC Sell 09 point, said 35% delivered.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T08:57:00Z Was yawning pretty heavily, slept just a bit over 5hrs last night so probably thats why.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T09:19:16Z Dumped semi-truck load again, says now 71% delivered.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T0931.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T0931.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-21T09:57:43Z Snoozing off while playing, sleep driving pretty much, dunno how am I this dead tired, gotta take a nap <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T12:41:07Z Back, already got up, ate some lunch and actually finished off three ArmA 3 terrain editing quick sessions heh.
</p>

<p>
Now back at PMC Gaming computer, FS22 v1.4.1 hotfix has been released, I tried the FS22 launcher upgrade feature which it always throws down your throat, it has NEVER frigging worked for me, I have no firewall no nothing, modhub etc in-game works fine so its not my internet, the frigging upgrade garbage just doesn't work.
</p>

<p>
So I had to download, again, that 13gb full Farming Simulator 22 Windows 10 game installer from giants eshop, well if they allow me to take their bandwidth I'm cool with it. I have now downloaded FS22 probably 5 times at least.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T12:44:06Z FS22 v1.4.1 full installer is running on top of the existing fully working game installation. It didn't ask for serial key as it was already in windows registry or where ever. Just takes few moments to get the installer done, even on M.2. NVMe device.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:00:21Z Finally in-game and continuing harvest contract for F06... But I'm just about had it with this fs22 garbage again, FS22 installer messed up so many times and didn't even work now, it launched the idiotic intro movies etc, but main menu now shows v1.4.1 so I went with it and loaded this savegame up <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T1302.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T1302.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:07:08Z Finished harvesting F06, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:13:19Z Dumped canola and contract finished but stopped immediately when the contract finished.
</p>

<p>
I then checked out which selling point pays the highest for the remaining canola load which was 13.7k liters, it was PMC Sell 10 with 2.2k per thousand liters. So drove there and dumped rest of the canola, budget now 25.1k. Then collected contract reward, budget now 73.4k.
</p>

<p>
Pretty OK for the first contract, now could lease rubicon and buy some liquid fertilizer tanks too.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:25:59Z Accepted contract to fertilize F04 for 46.5k, borrowed vehicle, solid fertilizer spreader.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T1327.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-04-21T1327.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:30:26Z Started fertilizing F04, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:47:35Z Finished fertilizing F04, contract.
</p>

<p>
Drove leased tractor and spreader back to the dealership, unloaded one fertilizer pallet. Collected contract reward of 41.3k, budget now 104.6k.
</p>

<p>
Pretty OK for two contracts. However now the 20FPS performance when looking at center heightmap direction and the piece of crap FS22 v1.4.1 upgrade mess is pissing me off so much that I'll call it quits here, clonezilla backup win10 + fs22 and install Linux Ubuntu desktop v22.04.
</p>

<p>
Not sure when I return to this savegame, but I will save the savegame dir and this story of course.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-21T13:54:09Z Saved game and exited FS22, bye <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Renamed current PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero savegame dir to savegame11.
