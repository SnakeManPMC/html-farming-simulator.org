	<h2>2024-09-20 OH-235 Road Object Placement Finished</h2>

<p>
2024-09-20T14:30:00Z New editing day has started, my sleeping schedule is way off and only got lousy 2hrs 47min sleep from which I tossed and turned probably the last half an hour before getting up, this doesn't look promising for my editing day as most likely I have to go take a nap at some point. Just now finished mandatory computer morning chores, added <a href="../25/news-pre-release/vehicles.php">FS25 Pre-Release News Vehicles</a> page info and screenshots, ate days first meal. Now begins editing session, I am actually feeling very good, very confident that today I will finish OH-235 road all the way to the south. Its just one of those days when you wake up and know you're about to get stuff done.
</p>

<p>
Next farm yard is E side of OH-235 just above "Bev's farm", this is fairly simple farm yard, in fact in my opinion this is not a farm yard this is just someones house with two garages, there are no grain bins or any signs of farming vehicles or equipment of any kind. Only thing about this simple farm yard is that I have no objects that fit those buildings, I can tell it right off the bat just by Mark 1 eyeballing them. Oh well, need to get by with what I got.
</p>

<p>
2024-09-20T14:51:00Z Finished building this new farm yard, err I mean place with buildings heh.
</p>

<p>
Yeah the dirt ground texture for farm yards and driveways is missing, dunno if I ever created it all the way to here in down south. Wont be a problem to do once I get around to it, I don't really need it when placing objects so its not worth to shuffle GE save/load with weight image changes, not now at least.
</p>

<p>
2024-09-20T15:10:00Z And the last location completed before "Bev's farm" area.

<p>
On the GE view the buildings cant be seen through the backplane US NAIP satellite imagery plane, but they are there.
</p>

<p>
In fact I need to chill out with these screenshots, I love reading dev diary with bunch of screenshots to show how it all went down, however... on a 10km x 10km terrain you just cannot have every single farm yard screenshotted, if someone (even me) reads this whole dev diary through at one go, all the pages, I mean... how many similar google/maps and GE screenshots you really want to see. Not sure if it would be easier to read and see those screenshots if they were not thumbnail + click-for-full-size setup, that the image would be much larger in the web page itself but there was no 4k full size desktop image to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
Guess in some ways its better to have too much content than too little, nobody is forcing you/me to click each and every full screen 4k desktop image heh.
</p>

<p>
Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Now I reached "Bev's farm" and went past it, next up is farm yards in both sides of OH-235 road, I have no idea if the same person/family owns these but to make editing easier in GE both of these will be placed in "location027" transformgroup.
</p>

<p>
2024-09-20T15:36:00Z Northern most west side farm yard done, now the second smaller one on east side.
</p>

<p>
2024-09-20T15:46:00Z And second farm yard done.

<p>
Well I still have to align those objects to ground as I wanted to take that GE screenshot with buildings showing up on top of that US NAIP backplane <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-09-20T15:55:00Z All objects aligned to ground now. Did a quick check and the whole OH-235 road is now complete from south of Alger town all the way to the terrain southern edge, whohoo! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now going to take a quick break especially as xr_renegade is scheduled to go live in youtube at 1200hrs noon EST.
</p>

<p>
He went live, I watched the stream and near end of it had to go get some sleep was so tired, today was a good day of PMC Ohio Alger 10km object placement along OH-235 road, very happy about the result.
