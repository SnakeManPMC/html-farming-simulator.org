	<h2>2022-12-20 Return After A Months Break</h2>

<p>
2022-12-20T05:56:00Z New farming day has started, this savegame now has 141hrs 1min on it. Alright so today's goal is very simple... I was extremely bored yesterday and now today after editing PMC Super Six 6km terrain a bit, only thing on my mind was this nagging feeling of Start From Zero savegame having incomplete harvest season. I really wanted to finish off the harvest season so I get to upgrade this terrain savegame without losing any progress.
</p>

<p>
Today I want to harvest as much as possible, would be great if I managed to harvest all the fields.
</p>

<p>
To recap mainly for myself, current game settings are 3 day seasons, which gives plenty of time to harvest, its now in-game oct 1st 0954hrs, so yeah plenty of time to harvest. Soybean fields left to harvest are: F39, F44, F41, F42 and F43 I think (its under courseplay text font). That is a lot of soybeans, so lets get started.
</p>

<p>
Our farm bin silo unia-something, has capacity for 900k liters and its 877k liters full now, so cannot unload even remaining grain cart. I do have elmers haulmaster 2000 which is currently used by fendt 1050 vario and empty demco dual auger 2200 grain cart but I recall from my months ago farming sessions that fendt 1050 vario struggles a bit to pull that beast so I preferred more light weight elmers haulmaster.
</p>

<p>
On the new farmland I bought recently is a farm yard with TONS of grain bin silos, flat bottom bin 3609's which need auger pipe to load and unload. Sickest thing is that this farm yard has 4 flat bottom bin 3609's and 4 flat bottom bin 3608's.
</p>

<p>
Meridian flat bottom bin 3608 holds 980k liters and 3609 holds 1.100m liters, so there is no question that can I store all the soybeans coming off the fields <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I don't recall ever using auger pipe in FS22 yet... this will be interesting. I got one of each (load and unload) auger pipes by the dealership.
</p>

<p>
Honestly I would prefer old fashioned drive through grain bin setup where I could just setup courseplay or in nowadays autodrive path, but lets give these auger pipes a try, I'm just a bit pessimistic because I know they are a bitch to setup with autodrive/courseplay courses, one slight false move and the house of cards will fall down and frustration levels are 100% then.
</p>

<p>
Sent fendt favorit 515c to the dealership to pickup first auger pipe. Then started to move claas lexion 8900s to the next soybeans field, but these guys and even grain cart tractor needs a diesel refuel, so got mack semi-truck with UTTS-3200 tanker trailer with diesel and went to refuel these guys.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T06:19:00Z Lexion 8900s and fendt 1050 vario refueled and fendt 515c favorit reached the dealership.
</p>

<p>
Hooked up auger pipe conveyall 1690 to fendt 515c favorit and autodrive sent him back to farm yard by the F39 with all the meridian grain bin silos. Once it reached there I tried to setup auger pipe to the first meridian 3609 bin, loaded semi-truck wilson pacesetter with 40k liters of soybeans... and the first attempt to unload from pacesetter into auger pipe failed. Yes I got 40k liters of soybeans into the bin but semi-truck tires collided with the auger pipe and knocked it off alignment, THIS is what I mean by the fucked up auger pipe stuff that I much more prefer drive-thru grain bin silo setups <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T06:44:00Z Tried it with another semi-truck wilson pacesetter grain grailer and nope, auger pipe conveyall 1690 loading "spoon" has full geometry so it will collide with semi-truck and trailer tires, you cannot just autodrive drive over it smoothly. I have no idea how to handle that grain unloading now because it would require baby sitting all semi-truck unloads then... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
While I'm pondering about this issue, I'll start harvesting F39 because its right next to our farm yard I can simply drive grain cart tractor directly to the meridian bins.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T06:51:00Z Saved game and started harvesting F39, courseplay 4x tools.
</p>

<p>
It actually felt good to be back harvesting soybeans with four lexion 8900s and driving grain cart fendt 1050 vario tractor <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Straight up!

<p>
Another grain cart unload. It is pretty cool to use auger pipes for grain bins... until it comes to autodrive / courseplay courses.

2022-12-20T07:26:00Z Headland complete, lead combine just started cutting the err normal rows.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay failed with combine number two at one point, it just stopped and disengaged courseplay. Whats the point of automation tool if it doesn't automate (its not working)? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well that didn't take too long for me to get sick and tired of the usual farmsim quircks <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T08:26:00Z First meridian flat bottom bin 3609 is already 50% full <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Struggling a bit as semi-truck grain trailers cannot be automated with that piece of shit auger pipe meridian bin setup, combines get full and stop, then I get into panic mode and its just one big stressful mess <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I am going to sell those flat bottom bins and purchase drive-thru grain bin setup, that will solve automation issue.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T08:40:00Z And frustration grows, combines 1 and 2 collided on end of the row, sigh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
ALL combines collided one-by-one, this was such a fucking colossal shit show I was just about to rage quit here. Courseplay just arent capable of plotting a field work course to certain shapes of fields without multiple tools convoy colliding, which begs the question again; whats the point of this mod then?
</p>

<p>
Feels like courseplay is designed for those claustrophobic little girlie men terrains where you only have one vehicle per field, yes sure in perfectly square implement width matching fields multiple tools convoy works perfectly, but unless you play on some piece of shit square field terrain... that's not how real fields are setup most of the time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This is kind of funny, I did not even last until first lunch break before getting extremely frustrated with fs22 + courseplay gui version. Of course there are similar issues in FS19 courseplay as well so yeah, but anyways.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T08:50:00Z And right after writing all the above, combine 3 went crazy and started to drive into random direction <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
For future reference this was courseplay v7.1.2.4, which actually happens to be the last stable release today.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T09:02:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F39, and not a moment too soon...
</p>

<p>
Yeah I'm calling it a day here, I am just not in the mood anymore after that frustration and anger of courseplay bugs / issues <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It is really funny how quickly after the starting enthusiasm I go to years of experience frustration & anger almost rage quitting feeling. Guess there is no way around it, win10 + fs22 + courseplay gui just sucks ass so BAD.
</p>

<p>
Farm yard F39 meridian flat bottom bin 3609 got 843.7k liters of soybeans now.
</p>

<p>
2022-12-20T09:06:00Z Saved game and exited fs22 shit.
</p>
