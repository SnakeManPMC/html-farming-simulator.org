	<h2>2023-01-09 Fertilizing Contracts Are Go</h2>

<p>
2023-01-09T20:42:00Z New farming day has started, todays goal is to buy our own land and vehicles, this savegame now has 4hrs 37min on it.
</p>

<p>
Oh we have some clear and big goals today, I like it hehe. Just woke up, did NOT do computer chores nor eat days first meal yet, I only checked PMC Tactical forum and giants forum before firing up PMC Gaming computer and loading this savegame up. I want to press hardcore 17hrs Start From Zero today, no excuses.
</p>

<p>
Savegame loaded up ok, back in massey ferguson pulling bredal k165 default configuration towards F0623 which is out fertilizing contract.
</p>

<p>
Lets get started <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2048.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2048.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-09T20:48:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0623, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
I drove this contract in endless headland mode, just didn't feel like doing the turn stop implement, turn, start implement and try to guess where your line/row is. Technically this endless headland is faster, your implement is constantly working.
</p>

<p>
This goes very smoothly actually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2058.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2058.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-09T21:00:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0623, did not collect money yet. I want to see if there are other fertilizing contracts I could do, bredal k165 default config is currently 88% full, so plenty of product left.
</p>

<p>
In contracts board found F0613 which was relatively (45km terrain, remember) close to my position, so took that contract without borrowing vehicles (were manure spreader anyways), hopefully I have enough product to finish the contract.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T21:04:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F0613.
</p>

<p>
F0613 is a fairly decent size field, better contracts usage shows 16.2k liters, well I only have 13.8k left so interesting to see how accurate better contracts usage is. I really don't want to drive all the way to the dealership and back for a refill. Its funny how I thought about everything else on large terrains for Start From Zero compatibility, but not the driving distances heh.
</p>

<p>
Thank goodness the field was just planted, so I can see where I spread.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T21:12:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0613, manually driving. This field is 0/180 oriented, so I'm going to use minimap (9) compass as a poor mans GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2114.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2114.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-09T21:23:00Z This fairly big field, 74ha... takes a while to do even one headland, just finished. This field has the cultivator_density image well beyond field definition, so I'm glad its only a single shape field definition <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Switched back to 90/270 row driving, that minimap (9) compass is pretty decent on this fairly smooth field, not much steering corrections going on, well not too bad at least.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T21:35:00Z Now I'm starving, gotta eat days first meal...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T22:01:00Z Feeding time is over, back to fertilizing F0613.
</p>

<p>
I'm stressed out if we run out of fertilizer, I don't mind the large field work, I just don't want to drive back and forth to the dealership for a refill. I don't have data at hand but I wouldn't be surprised if one round trip would take good 20min or so.
</p>

<p>
But hey, its the worries and stress of beginning Start From Zero <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I've done many Start From Zero's on large terrains, but this is the first time on truly gigantic terrain, hell largest of them all. After this I still have to edit, fix, autodrive network record and begin Start From Zero in PMC Korkscrew 40km terrain, uuh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T22:24:00Z Contract is now 50% done and I have 45% fertilizer left, hmm don't have enough experience (in this situation) to say whether we have enough product.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 1751hrs night is starting to fall, still 3k liters of fertilizer left, contract is 81% complete, would be so great to have this finished without refilling and before night falls. Lets hope so.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T23:00:00Z Contract is 90% complete and I got 1.6k liters of fertilizer left ...
</p>

<p>
When I hit 1k liters of fertilizer contract was 95% complete... this one is getting close ...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2316.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2316.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-09T23:15:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0613, collected reward 139.4k. Had 400 liters left <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Contract fertilizing F0623, collected reward 18.4k and returned borrowed / leased vehicles. Budget now 191.6k nice. As its mar in-game 1817hrs with night falling quick, I'm going to time accelerate until tomorrow morning. Apr in-game 0608hrs, did not go all the way up to 0900hrs as I want to squeeze in as much daylight out of today as possible, just in case there are many fertilizing contracts available.
</p>

<p>
A lot of weeding contracts appeared, for 74ha field they pay 40k, heh ouch, not going to take any of those "offerings" <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
More contracts refreshing and baling contracts appeared, guess its spring time. Most realistic one was for F0013 33.8ha with must deliver 1.711m liters, so heh when I say "most realistic" its kind of like dude, are you crazy haha. But yeah this contract once completed would basically blow the bank and allow me to buy pretty much any fertilizing equipment, guaranteed this would be over half a million total profit. But yeah I am not going to do such crazy big contract, not yet at least.
</p>

<p>
When looking at these remaining fertilizing contracts they are almost teaser alike placed evenly very far out around the dealership so driving distances are maxed out, well more or less at least that's how it feels like heh. But hey, this is a huge terrain adjust your attitude Mister! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah I guess, *grumble* ... *grumble* ... 
</p>

<p>
<img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Did some calculations, bredal k165 with extensions and fendt favorit 515c would cost JUST 6 grand more than I have money right now, not to mention how would I buy fertilizer product if all my money went to equipment, so yeah I still have to do one round of fertilizing contracts using borrowed vehicles. I just don't like the default-kit bredals, but hey what can you do.
</p>

<p>
Go hard or go home, decided to accept one fertilizing contract with bredal k165 for its capacity, then accept all remaining fertilizing contracts without vehicles just so I can see the flashing field numbers on mapview for easier navigation.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to write them all down except when starting to do them, but F0148 is the contract right in the north edge where I got bredal k165 and massey ferguson tractor.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-09T23:36:00Z Ugh, when I accepted borrowed vehicles contract for F0148, it simply disappeared! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now I have to cancel all the remaining accepted contracts because I got no vehicles hah. Had to shuffle a bit to get F0394 to offer borrow bredal k165 which I accepted.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 2.
</p>

<p>
Refilling operation.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2341.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2341.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Once refilled I saved game, this is a good place to do so. Decided to head towards F0789 which is in NW from the dealership, the closest contract field.
</p>

<p>
On the way.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2349.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-09T2349.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-09T23:58:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0789, manually driving. This field is growing plants and I cannot see anything, so a complete blind spreading, this is going to be a pain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Just need to drive orientating myself at the end of the field and then keep minimap (9) compass to 90/270 and trust everything comes together to finish the contract. Doing contracts like these blind makes you really Really REALLY appreciate autodrive, courseplay and GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This contract pays 137k so after its done I'm going to buy my own tractor and bredal k165 and if I can find cheap enough land, then that too so I get to use automation tools.
</p>

<p>
New fertilizing contracts are slowly trickling in, accepted bunch more.
</p>

<p>
Not fun ... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0012.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T00:51:00Z Contract is now 51% complete and I have 8.4k liters (53%) fertilizer left. Just spent some time ALT-TABbed to text editor to write some windows 8.1 support ending message info. I have become quite numb for this fertilizing contract about now, got good muscle memory going on at field ends on turns, can more or less nicely align the bredal k165 spread into existing field spread edge, things are just rolling with muscle memory while I'm numb thinking about stuff.
</p>

<p>
I simply cannot wait after this contract is done to buy my own tractor + bredal k165 and also scan if there are any cheap enough land to buy so I could crack into automation tools, but most likely I still have to do one more contract after this, but for that contract I want a planted field where I can see the fertilizerd spots on the field, I just hate this blind field work, it feels so dumb, frustrating and useless.
</p>

<p>
All I know is our own land + vehicles taste SO sweet once we get there, which is kind of the whole point of Start From Zeros, to make you appreciate the good equipment.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T01:35:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0789, collected reward 137.8k. Saved game and then restroom break...
</p>

<p>
Budget now 300.2k, oh nice <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Refreshed contracts and large number of new fertilizing contracts appeared. I should start to think about the long run stuff, first would be the bredal k165 with extensions, then vehicle + land so I get to use autodrive, courseplay and GPS. To get a base line I went to search cheapest land first because that is always terrain specific and varies quite a lot in price.
</p>

<p>
Farmland number 14 is a farm yard, its super small so therefore super cheap, costs only 45.5k and smallest actual farm field is farmland number 33 for 76.3k so yeah guess I'll be buying the number 14.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T02:13:00Z Spent some time chatting with penalty_box in his stream. After that made a list of stuff to buy. Did not buy these yet:
</p>

<pre>
- spreader 18m 18km/h 18.9k liters bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit for 88.5k
- tractor 175hp new holland t6.175 with guidancesteering 142k
- farmland id 14, 45.5k
===
276k
</pre>

<p>
I have few big bags of solid fertilizer by the dealership and budget after buying above list would be 24.2k which is enough for 16 big bags of fertilizer, yeah I think we can work with that.
</p>


	<h2>Own Land And Vehicle</h2>

<p>
2023-01-10T02:16:00Z Purchased the above list plus ACGO 650kg front weight for 700, budget now 23.5k.
</p>

<p>
Then purchased as many big bags of fertilizer as I had money. Budget now 1.7k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Started to drive borrowed massey ferguson + bredal k165 back to the dealership, it still has 1.9k liters of fertilizer and even though its the default kitted k165, I can still hook it up with courseplay to fertilizer a contract while I do my own stuff.
</p>

<p>
So yeah now we already own land + vehicle so autodrive, courseplay and GPS comes into play on the next contract, actually I'll fire up autodrive once this borrowed massey ferguson reaches the network <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T02:23:00Z Borrowed bredal k165 now coming home using autodrive, first time use in this Start From Zero savegame <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Our first own vehicle + equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0224.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0224.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Also production inspector popped up on top-left corner, apparently the farmland ID 14 farm yard I bought had several placeables, liquid fertilizer tank * 2, meridian flat bottom bin 3608 * 2 and solid fertilizer tank * 2. I might start to use those.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T02:33:00Z Borrowed bredal reached the dealership and I unloaded remaining fertilizer, loaded them up to our own bredal k165 and its now got 14.7k liters, saved game just to have good base to continue playing.
</p>

<p>
Hmm but that amount of fertilizer we have, only 14.7k liters... that is very little, I need to be careful which field we do next so can get it done and more money for fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Accepted all remaining fertilizing contracts without borrowing vehicles, we now have 47 contracts. Maybe in the long run I should have left few or taken them with borrowed vehicles because once money comes in and I get bored GPS driving, then more vehicles would help. I mean 47 contracts is a crazy amount. But once we get there, get few contracts done with GPS, I'm sure there will be plenty of more contracts available.
</p>

<p>
Sent my bredal k165 with autodrive to F0806 S, its nearby one of our contract fields which is the traditional 74ha size. F0002 was right next to the dealership but that is a big field I don't think our 14.7k liters of fertilizer is enough, I need to make more money to buy more fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T02:56:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0902, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Feels SO GOOD to field work using GPS ! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0256.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0256.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Switched to cab view, I want to just enjoy the ride <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This is going to be a long ass day in the farm, all those countless (well 47) fertilizing contracts (for now) and when money starts to come in, about 137k per contract, then I get to purchase another bredal k165 and eventually rubicon sprayer too, ooh its going to be good times in PMC King Corn 45km Start From Zero <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Nice view.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0259.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0259.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T03:00:00Z Its time for lunch break ...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T03:24:00Z Feeding time is over, back to fertilizing!
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0339.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0339.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
In my PMC Cereal Region 32km Start From Zero compatibility test savegame I used 4 * bredal k165s and 2 * rubicon 9000s + semi-truck liquid tanker trailer to make over 2 million in cash before I sort of got tired of playing at the time, dunno... wonder what happens here, how much money do I need before ending playing or purchasing my own land for regular field work soybeans farming, hmm?
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to repeat that savegames issues, so now we have borrowed massey ferguson and bredal k165 default kitted, so as soon as current contract is is done and I have enough money, I buy fertilizer, fill that borrowed vehicle up, send it to its field and get it done so I can return that incompatible size bredal spreader.
</p>

<p>
In this savegame we have so many fertilizing contracts now available and more is coming when refreshing the board, that its just matter of doing enough of them to grow our vehicle fleet to achieve such millions of budget wealth.
</p>

<p>
Overall the goal is to get as many vehicles as possible to the fields, there are so many contracts that with only a single vehicle its waste of time to spend even a minute of doing it.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T04:01:00Z Contract 50% complete, 7.5k liters (39%) fertilizer left.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T04:48:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0902, collected reward 137.8k, had only 447 liters of fertilizer left <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 139.4k, plenty of money to buy all the fertilizer we need. Sent bredal k165 to the dealership using autodrive while I went to take a restroom break.
</p>

<p>
Hmm my plan was to go straight away to do F0394 with borrowed vehicles to get rid of those, but now I'm thinking that maybe I should do F0002 which is opposite of the dealership using these both vehicles so it would be done quickly, only after that go finish 394... hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 4 heh, budget now 81.1k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Refilled bredal k165 full 18.9k liters. Courseplay recorded field definition outline for F0002, saved game just in case. Then generated field work course without headland as there is plenty of room on the field.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T05:11:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0002, courseplay, ETA 2h 54min.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k.
</p>

<p>
Refilled borrowed bredal, then started to fertilize F0002 with manual GPS driving from rear end of the courseplay field work course. I did see from the mapview that this is a bigger field, but I didn't truly realize how massive it is before I drove across it hehe.
</p>

<p>
Manually GPS, supporting our own bredal k165.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0519.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0519.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Hmm I'm actually worried do we have enough fertilizer for this field, but hmm 66.6k left so should be enough <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T06:02:00Z Contract now 55% complete, hmm looking at these numbers I think I was just too shocked by the size of this field but there is no problems finishing this with our budget, I would not be surprised anymore if we would finish this without refills.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0606.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0606.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Almost done.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0637.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T0637.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T06:39:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0002, collected reward 266k. Whoah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 332.6k whoah dude <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game and took a restroom break already planning what vehicles we buy next hehe.
</p>

<p>
This contract shows us that fertilizer product should not be underestimated, if you are too greedy to purchase new vehicles and equipment leaving no money for product then your fancy new toys are idling at the dealership because they have no product to expend on the fields.
</p>

<p>
Drove bredal new holland t6.175 with k165 to the dealership and refilled what big bags we had left there. Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 2. Refilled bredal k165 full, then drove borrowed massey ferguson and bredal k165 default to the dealership. Refilled with what we had left there, heh same as above hehe. Budget now 274.3k.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed contracts and more and more fertilizing contracts appeared, there are now just silly number of them in the board, its just crazy, all we would need is a huge fertilizing vehicle fleet and we would be bathing in money. Saved game just in case again.
</p>

<pre>
- spreader 18m 18km/h 18.9k liters bredal k165 with extension and 6m spreading unit for 88.5k
- tractor 175hp new holland t6.175 with guidancesteering 142k
- weight agco 650kg 700
===
231.2k
</pre>

<p>
2023-01-10T06:56:00Z Purchased the above list, budget now 43.1k just enough to buy a lot of fertilizer hehe.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2023-01-10T07:00:00Z Another savegame here at the dealership, man I'm wild with these saves, but hey don't want to lose any progress by stupid game bugs / issues.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sent all tractors to F0898 S which will be out next contract field, yes yes the borrowed bredal return, but hold up, one more 74ha fertilizing contract <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Plan is to record courseplay field definition outline for F0898, then start t6.175s under courseplay and I'll start from end of the field work course manually GPS driving, as usual. But yes, let this be the last contract like that, next one will be the returning borrowed vehicles I don't want to hang around with them any more.
</p>

<p>
Its absolutely hilarious how HUGE PMC King Corn 45km terrain really is, looking at mapview sending those tractors to F0898 S doesn't look like its far at all... but once they start to drive there 53km/h you realize how snail pace they move in the mapview and in 3D you see the just massive vast american farming landscape slooooowly roll by <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T07:28:00Z Bredals arrived to F0898 S, then courseplay recorded field definition outline, then saved game.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T07:30:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0898, courseplay, 2x tools, ETA 51min.
</p>

<p>
Moments later borrowed massey ferguson and default kitted bredal k165 driven by me with GPS started from the end of the course, well fields N side in this case as there was no headland.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T08:03:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0898, collected reward 139.4k.
</p>

<p>
Another savegame while I go to the head heh. Then used second new holland t6.175 pulling bredal k165 with extensions to record autodrive network waypoint routes to F0932 E where our next fertilizing contract is, however that was a bad choice because t6.175 even with 650kg front weight was WAY underpowered to pull that beastly bredal k165 with extensions. But I got the job done, then sent rest of the fertilizing fleet to F0932 E.
</p>

<p>
Courseplay recorded field definition outline for F0908, then saved game, heh I'm just nuts with these game saves today dunno why, or well yeah I don't want to lose good progress, that is why. Problem is that 45km terrain saves FOREVER, one time I actually started save, went to the restroom, took a leak, washed my hands, came back and right then save finished, heh nuts.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T08:23:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0908, courseplay, 2x tools, ETA 51min.
</p>

<p>
Did not start bredal number two becaus there was a huge overlap in the beginning of the field work course. Moments later started borrowed bredal driving manually GPS from the S side of the field (opposite side). Will wait until lead bredal comes back so I can see where do I need to start bredal number two to avoid useless overlap.
</p>

<p>
These vehicles now had roughly 70% of fertilizer in the tank, hopefully its enough to finish this field, I don't want to do the dealership refill trip, it takes forever.
</p>

<p>
Oh and my alarm for lunch break went off several minutes ago, pfft! I have no time for your lunches! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T08:30:00Z Started bredal number two as I now see that it could start from the second row just fine without creating any (big) gaps in the fertilizing coverage.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T08:34:00Z Okay time to take that lunch break now as courseplay is running fertilizing contract ...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T09:00:00Z Feeding time is over, okay we keep fertilizing before tonight is over!
</p>

<p>
Race is ON!
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T09:05:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0908, collected reward 139.4k. Saved game, you know me, today <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 292.9k. Autodrive sent all vehicles to the dealership. Back to the home plate. After tractors had already driven quite a bit I checked autodrive ETA to destination, it was 21min haha.
</p>

<p>
These tractors keep traveling between fields and the dealership (counting round trip) longer than it takes to fertilize one field heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T09:28:00Z Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 4. Then started to refill bredals.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T09:33:00Z All bredals refilled, save game heh.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sent t6.175s to F0004 N. Then recorded courseplay field definition outline for F0004. Going to put new holland t6.175s working on this field while I drive borrowed bredal to F0394, do that field and return the borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T09:48:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0004, courseplay, 2x tools, ETA 3hrs 7min.
</p>

<p>
Geez, three hours? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 1636hrs so its going to be fully dark when this contract is done, wow.
</p>

<p>
Uuh three hours...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T10:01:00Z Started recording autodrive network waypoints route towards F0394 field using borrowed massey ferguson 8s.245 pulling bredal k165 default kitted. Bad vehicle, but as I'm going there why not record route.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T10:47:00Z Reached F0657, ridiculously small contract on it, lets get it done while watching twitch stream heh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T10:48:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0657, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T10:52:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0657, collected reward 6.1k.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T11:11:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0394, manually GPS. This is the borrowed massey ferguson 8s.245 and bredal k165 default kit vehicle contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1118.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1118.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T11:20:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0394, did not collect reward because I want to drive borrowed vehicles back towards the dealership to connect autodrive loop.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T11:32:00Z Now first bredal k165 is empty, needs a refill.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k * 2. Refilled first bredal k165. Uuh I'm just about had it buying those big bags and refilling them one 1k liters at the time with R key slowly as well, I need to buy iconik's solid fertilizer refill station placeable <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T11:44:00Z Purchased iconik's solid fertilizer refill station for 7.7k. Refilled second bredal k165.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T11:48:00Z Both bredals are back in the field work course, lets get this thing done before night fall.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1148.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1148.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T12:17:00Z Reached end of autodrive loop by F0003 SE corner. Decided to take borrowed bredal to help F0004 fertilizing. Contract is 77% complete.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T12:33:00Z Started to feel a bit numb for this long day of playing, need to go refreshen up a bit in shower.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T12:47:00Z Back, we continue fertilizing... except right at the same moment as I sat down, I kidd you not, this contract finished heh talking about timing <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T12:47:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0004, collected reward 557.2k. Oh my half a million, wow maan...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T12:50:00Z Contract fertilizing F0394, collected reward 12k.
</p>

<p>
Unloaded all solid fertilizer from borrowed massey ferguson and bredal k165 default kit setup, then returned it by collecting that reward, finally got rid of that borrowed black sheep vehicle heh. Then autodrive sent both bredals back to the dealership, second one needs fertilizer refill too.
</p>

<p>
Purchased diesel fuel refill station placeable, put it by the dealership building, refueled both t6.175s. Saved game, it was the perfect spot after all these accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 732.6k geez dude, thats a whole lotta money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 1948hrs night has fallen, almost completely dark, time accelerating until morning daylight. May in-game 0503hrs rise and shine, stopped time accelerating when daylight broke, just in case we are going to do more fertilizing contracts, don't want to run out of daylight.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T13:06:00Z Accepted all the remaining fertilizing contracts. Now comes the age old question, what to buy next. Rubicon 9000 is always go to vehicle once you get the money, but humm.
</p>

<p>
Took a look at my phone alarm, 23min until I've been up 17hrs straight farming and it would be my bed time, don't feel tired yet but definitely lost the almost hyperventilating alike enthusiasm from earlier today, hmm.
</p>

<p>
The thing with these massive amounts of fertilizing contracts is that where do you start? What difference does it make? Its strange but lets say you had one or two fertilizing contracts, then your motivation to do those would be completely different. As of right now I don't even bother to count the contracts because there are... I would claim that more than a hundred, no idea but its just unending list heh.
</p>

<p>
Sure we need money for big farming and fertilizing contracts are there for the taking, go after them, get the moneyz <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yup, but hmm dunno <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to buy two more new holland t6.175 tractors with 650kg front weight and of course bredal k165 with extensions. Hooked them all up and refilled them, budget now 209.5k.
</p>

<p>
Okay lets find closest field and go fertilize it.
</p>

<p>
Recorded autodrive network waypoint route to F0059 S, then sent rest of the bredals there. With lead vehicle recorded courseplay field definition outline. Saved game before generating courseplay course, no headland even though there are trees on other side of the road at E edge, should not be a problem.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T13:38:00Z Started contract fertilizing F0059, courseplay, 4x tools, ETA 57min.
</p>

<p>
Whole convoy is on the move, 400m intervals.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1342.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-King-Corn-45km-2023-01-10T1342.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC King Corn 45km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-10T13:44:00Z Went to see our farm yard, that farmland ID 14, well it was pretty shitty, just those mentioned placeables and the flat bottom bins were on elevated ground so one end stuck out of the ground in ugly way. There was no vehicle shed or anything else.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to stay awake this 53min that courseplay shows as ETA now, I'd hate to go to sleep leaving course unfinished. But maybe this might be too long time to just sit here and watch courseplay does it job for almost an hour, ouch.
</p>

<p>
Going to save some time and go check some RSS news while field work is in progress <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T14:09:00Z Done checking most important RSS news, man I am so tired brain is shutting down its difficult to function anymore, in full zombi mode, courseplay shows 29min to go, uuh I don't think I can last that long..
</p>

<p>
Most of the remaining fertilizing contracts I accepted... just disappeared, poof. However now that I refreshed contracts board some of these contracts appeared, for example I remember the tiny F0385.
</p>

<p>
Early morning in PMC King Corn 45km but a very late night last screenshot for me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2023-01-10T14:32:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F0059, collected reward 311.3k. Budget now 520.8k.
</p>

<p>
Okay I am in so full zombi mode its time to sleep...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-10T14:35:00Z Saved game and shutdown fs22, good night.
