	<h2>2021-12-07 Windows 10 M.2 NVMe Install</h2>

<p>
2021-12-07T12:23:00Z New farming day has started, got a new win10 pro install to M.2 NVMe device and starting, well continuing, this savegame again.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 144hrs 29min on it.
</p>

<p>
Set greenhouses to sell mode again as lettuce price was pretty good. Then some time accelerating one hour at the time.
</p>

<p>
In-game jul 2203hrs now lettuce prices are dropping badly so I switched greenhouses to storing mode.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T12:49:00Z Restarted game to add additional field info mod. Unfortunately it was trash, it only added useless hectare count to farmland page, this is not the additional field info mod (I was looking for).
</p>

<p>
Okay F57 is harvest ready canola, going to flip that field.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T13:12:00Z Started to harvest canola on F57.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T13:23:00Z CTD.

<p>
Sigh.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T13:28:00Z New try, combine repaired and by the field, game saved, lets start harvesting canola F57, again.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:00:00Z Finished harvesting canola F57, got total of 48.9k liters, sold back the farmland lot.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:02:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Canola market price in goldcrest valley was 2.1k which is pretty decent, unloaded grain trailer into the railroad silo and then called train and send it to sell.
</p>

<p>
Sold the canola for 103.6k, budget now 1.438m. Sold fliegl dts lowboy trailer.
</p>

<p>
Took contract to fertilize F38 which is close to my farm yard.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:19:00Z Finished fertilizing contract on F38, collected reward 10.4k.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:32:00Z Restarted game to add place/paint anywhere mods and also edited reduced maintenance cost to /10.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:38:00Z CTD. Was ALT-TABbed to check out new mods and it just crashed on the background.
</p>

<p>
At this time added fill level warning sound for harvesters mod.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T14:50:00Z CTD.
</p>

<p>
Its time to get busy and make some money, I want to start direct drilling soybeans right after harvest, then use rubicon 9000 to fertilize and herbicide spray once field stages change. In FS22 I have several field stages so there is plenty of time to spray and rubicon 9000 doesn't destroy crops so whole spraying is relaxed.
</p>

<p>
Only thing I need is some seed delivery vehicle, guess that small auto loading trailer is best at the moment, should hold enough seeds for these fields.
</p>

<p>
And speaking of fields, I need to buy as many farmlands as I can around my farm yard. Guess it would make sense to buy only large and easily worked field farmlands, but I just want to buy then gradually around my farm yard.
</p>

<p>
Took two fertilizing contracts.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T15:06:00Z Finished fertilizing F38, accepted reward 19k, budget now 1.468m.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T15:12:00Z Alarm went off, time to eat...
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T15:35:00Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T15:44:00Z Soybeans F33 AI owned field is ready to harvest, I'm going to flip that one.

<p>
2021-12-07T16:34:00Z Fucking finally finished harvesting soybeans F33 and sold the farmland back. Got total of 27.7k liters.
</p>

<p>
Dumped all of the soybeans into eastern railroad silo, then sold it to goldcrest valley for 90.1k, budget now 1.549m.
</p>

<p>
In-game nov, going to time accelerate to soybeans planing season before I buy any farmland just in case if there is some planted crops I could take advantage of.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T16:52:00Z Lettuce market price 3.9k on red marble so switched greenhouses to selling mode.
</p>

<p>
In-game feb 0154hrs lettuce market price started to fall, hoping to squeeze in few more hours of selling. In-game 0430hrs price was down to 3.5k so I switched greenhouses to storing mode.
</p>

<p>
In-game mar 1134hrs bread market price 5k in johnsons farmers market, off to sell.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T1710.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T1710.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T1722.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T1722.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
This is fun, have to think about logistics, to buy these source items first before going crazy bying land heh.
</p>

<p>
Now my massey ferguson strautmann auto load trailer was carrying 10.5k liters of seeds heh.
</p>

<p>
Next was the exciting moment of purchasing new land <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T17:23:00Z Purchased land lots with F36 and F37 for 225.2k where F36 had growing canola. F30 for 226.6k which had growing canola. F69 for 397.7k. F38 for 393.6k. F68 for 614.2k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 123.4k (no, it really was 1234 heh). No more money to buy farmland, nowhere nearby at least. I'm sure after this next soybeans season I have tons of money to buy more fields.
</p>

<p>
Now, lets start planting soybeans <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T17:35:00Z Started soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T19:36:00Z Had couple of CTDs but was watching big_guy86 stream so didn't write them down. Now john deere 7r tractor repair condition dropped below 50% and its planting speed reduced to 13km/h (from 15), saved game, exited and tried to edit savegame vehicles.xml to zero out the maintenance bullshit... but don't know which is the repair/damage.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T2040.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-07T2040.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Decided to use vehicle explorer ALT-R which repairs vehicle, but I remember from FS19 that this is crazy expensive dunno why. However when I ran it on FS22 now, it was mere 25-50 or so, very low amount, guess it respects the reduced repair cost mod values.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-07T20:47:00Z Not really tired but 17hrs alarm went off a while ago, time to go to sleep, soybeans planting season continues tomorrow for sure.
