	<h2>PMC Test Farm 10km</h2>

<p>
This mod has errors, don't download. A very bad big map, with big square fields :)
</p>

<p>
This terrain is not meant for playing as its a simply testing version for 10.2km x 10.2km terrain size. However I was asked to share example files to test some things, so I uploaded this terrain and thought why not share with everyone.
</p>

<p>
This is empty object-less terrain, there are no buildings, no trees and no selling points. Heightmap is flat 0 meter elevation, no hills no nothing. There are many square fields all the same size, these fields are painted in cultivator_density and there are no field definitions so contracts will not work.
</p>

<p>
There is a vehicle shop triggers only (no 3D building), no vehicle repair trigger either. Farmland image is one ID covers all style.
</p>

<p>
Terrain is not in multiplayer compatible ZIP format, its an open directory only, works fine in single player.
