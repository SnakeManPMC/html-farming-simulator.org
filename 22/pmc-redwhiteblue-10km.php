<p>
That list was field definition size in hectares, the actual 3D in-game fields are much larger because cultivator_density has been painted to a nice shape where field definition (the part AI uses for contracts) only covers a simple shape area.
</p>

<p>
Only few fields have field definitions (numbers, AI planting and contracts) to get players started, then it is up to the player to purchase land and farm the actual fields. This is by design, its not a bug, its not lazyness, we wanted it this way. There are plenty enough contracts to do and its challenging and fun to actually farm your own fields instead making money out of contracts when every field offers them.
</p>

	<h2>Placeable Objects</h2>

<p>
When you start a savegame and not own any land with placeables, nothing shows up in ESC mapview or minimap, once you buy the land with placeables, objects like buildings appear in mapview and then you get to use them, including selling them all if you do not like their placement. No more hardcoded farm yards! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_cool.gif" alt="Smiley :cool:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Placeable objects appear in farm yards. These building objects are for example vehicle sheds, grain bin silos, fertilizer tanks (liquid/solid), diesel fuel tank, water tank etc.
</p>

<p>
Land purchase areas are detailed so that you can buy small and cheap farm yards areas. No need to save money for big huge millions costing land area if you only want to get the cool farm yard with buildings on it.
</p>

	<h2>Game-play</h2>

<p>
Selling points: total of 12 selling points are distributed around the terrain. Selling points accept all grains and production chain products. Special animal dealer bale selling point is located by the ... the.. umm cant remember where heh.
</p>

<p>
Contracts: AI does planting on numbered fields, contracts are available. Plenty of money to be made on these contract fields which sizes span from 0.4 to over 32 hectares.
</p>

<p>
Remaining fields are just painted cultivator_density without field number or rest of the field definition. Courseplay and hired workers should function on these un-numbered fields, if they do not please send us feedback and we'll add field numbers for courseplay usage.
</p>

<p>
Farm Manager and Start From Scratch game-modes include the AI owned farm yards with buildings, once you buy the land you own the buildings with ability to sell them all, same as in New Farmer game-mode where player owns one farm yard by default.
</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This terrain was not meant for playing as its a simply testing version for 10.2km x 10.2km terrain size. However I was asked to share example files to test some things, so I uploaded this terrain and thought why not share with everyone. A week or so later I edited some more and added bunch of new features like rolling hills heightmap, grass, terrain detail textures for roads, three Meridian flat bottom 3608 grain bins and a vehicle shop building. A bit later added TrailerParkFarms (TPF) big vehicle sheds as well. Made placeables functional so they can be sold etc. So technically this is now more or less a normal terrain.
</p>

<p>
In short there was no specific plan to create a 10km terrain and release it... that just sort of happened on its own <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

	<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>
PMC RedWhiteBlue 10km terrain has basic buildings, utility poles and trees placed. Basic object placement is complete, more tweaks follow after game-play testing has produced results. If you find bugs, missing features or other issues of any kind, please send feedback so we can investigate.
</p>

<p>
Player feedback is very important to us, please feel free to share any feedback you think of while farming on this terrain.
