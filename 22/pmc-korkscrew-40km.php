Its now up to you if you can take the these vehicles plus 100,000 of money and conquer the whole terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
That list was field definition size in hectares, the actual 3D in-game fields are much larger because cultivator_density has been painted to a nice shape where field definition (the part AI uses for contracts) only covers a simple shape area.
</p>

<p>
Only few fields have field definitions (numbers, AI planting and contracts) to get players started, then it is up to the player to purchase land and farm the actual fields. This is by design, its not a bug, its not lazyness, we wanted it this way. There are plenty enough contracts to do and its challenging and fun to actually farm your own fields instead making money out of contracts when every field offers them.
</p>

	<h2>Placeable Objects</h2>

<p>
When you start a savegame and not own any land with placeables, nothing shows up in ESC mapview or minimap, once you buy the land with placeables, objects like buildings appear in mapview and then you get to use them, including selling them all if you do not like their placement. No more hardcoded farm yards! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_cool.gif" alt="Smiley :cool:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Placeable objects appear in farm yards. These building objects are for example vehicle sheds, grain bin silos, fertilizer tanks (liquid/solid), diesel fuel tank, water tank etc.
</p>

<p>
Land purchase areas are detailed so that you can buy small and cheap farm yards areas. No need to save money for big huge millions costing land area if you only want to get the cool farm yard with buildings on it.
</p>

	<h2>Game-play</h2>

<p>
Selling points: total of 12 selling points are distributed around the terrain. Selling points accept all grains and production chain products. Special animal dealer bale selling point is located by the ... the.. umm cant remember where heh.
</p>

<p>
Contracts: AI does planting on numbered fields, contracts are available. Plenty of money to be made on these contract fields which sizes span from small to large.
</p>

<p>
Remaining fields are just painted cultivator_density without field number or rest of the field definition. Courseplay and hired workers should function on these un-numbered fields.
</p>

<p>
Farm Manager and Start From Scratch game-modes include the AI owned farm yards with buildings, once you buy the land you own the buildings with ability to sell them all, same as in New Farmer game-mode where player owns one farm yard by default.
</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
On 2022-01-18 PMC Korkscrew 40km terrain was our and well the whole communitys first 40km x 40km size farmsim terrain, it was meant to be the biggest and baddest thing on the hood, however before this even got released we already created and released <a href="pmc-king-corn-45km.php">PMC King Corn 45km</a> which is the largest terrain in the history of Farming Simulator games. So PMC Korkscrew 40km was kind of without a purpose at that point.
</p>

<p>
Release goal was the largest terrain, but it is not the largest anymore. So much work was put into farm yards, forest/tree and utility pole lines that it would have been shame not to release this for everyone to enjoy. Still this is not your regular polished terrain with super tight details, obviously considering the size and scope.
</p>

<p>
Yes we know Corkscrew is the proper spelling with a C, but we decided to give this terrain a bit more unique name so hence the K use on the cork.
</p>
