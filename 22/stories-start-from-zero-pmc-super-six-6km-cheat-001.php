	<h2>2022-09-21 Savegame Creation</h2>

<p>
2022-09-21T17:22:00Z PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero begins now.
</p>

<p>
Just finishing up configuring mods with gameSettings.xml file. Started farm manager game mode with <a href="pmc-super-six-6km.php">PMC Super Six 6km</a> v0.2.2 release. Then configured in-game settings for maintenance cost and repair cost to 25%, turned off plow, lime and other nonsense.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T17:36:00Z Configuring done, saved game to get a dir. Then exited to edit some savegame XMLs.
</p>

<p>
Reset money to zero and vehicles.xml removed all contents (its a bug in v0.2.2 terrain configs).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T17:43:00Z FS22 back up and savegame loaded, everything looks good, 0 money, 0 vehicles, 0 land, I'm all zeroed out.
</p>

<p>
Alright so background. Previously I already played Start From Zero in this terrain, but that was horrible and shameful failure because I stepped to the dark side and started to use money making placeables, it went completely crazy and ruined my savegame, you can read all about it in <a href="stories-start-from-zero-pmc-super-six-6km-plcb.php">Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km (placeables)</a>.
</p>

<p>
As I'm stubborn man of principle, I want to get this done right even though I really don't have the time or that my time would be best used to do other more meaningful things, even as simple as playing <a href="../19/stories-from-zero-grande-gardens.php">Start From Zero PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a> instead. I just want to get this done right and also get to my own land and fields farming as quickly as possible instead of dragging out doing contracts for days in real life time. Last night I read <a href="../stories.php" target="_blank">FS17 Cornbelt From Scratch</a> which started all this from zero business and was shocked to see how quickly I managed to get my farm started there. Sure since FS17 there has been two game engines worth of changes especially to how contracts are done, but still I feel that my previous savegames have been way too long in the getting started part. Buy the land and seeder + combine and get to work, everything else is meaningless.
</p>

<p>
I want to redeem myself from that shameful act of using cheats. I don't give a flying fuck if it takes the next two three weeks of my life to do it, my whole october 2022 schedule is free so I have plenty of time to finish one 6.1km Start From Zero savegame. Although I really don't have plans to ACTUALLY finish this in one go, but... its a possibility. We'll see how it goes, one day at the time.
</p>

<p>
FS17 Cornbelt From Scratch which started this all had a rule: no GPS or courseplay (I did not use autodrive at the time nor do I even know if it was made for FS17) until you buy your own LAND and VEHICLE(s). This is a big change to my previous FS19/FS22 start from zeros where I started to use GPS (not so much courseplay) right after purchasing my first own vehicle, I never waited to the land purchase, honestly I forgot the rule in FS19 and never looked back since, until yesterday. Now that is changed; no autodrive, courseplay or guidancesteering until I own vehicle + land. Read more details from <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=22739" target="_blank">Start From Zero - Getting Started and Rules</a>.
</p>

<p>
Also PMC Super Six 6km was just updated to v0.2.2 mere minutes ago which includes more fields and several grass baling fields, cannot wait to do some baling contracts.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T17:49:00Z Okay I'm ready to start working.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T17:52:00Z Accepted contract baling F07.
</p>

<p>
Its really nice that better contracts latest version v1.2.0.4 or something, now shows which contract has borrowed vehicles <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T1752.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T1752.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Field seven was basically the other side of the terrain heh, oh well, lets drive <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:09:00Z Arrived to the field, actually took a wrong turn so it was kind of detour which added few more minutes of driving time, but yes its a long way up here for sure and with baling contracts when you have to swap those equipment, uuh its going to take a long time. But I'm enjoying myself, just relaxing, chilling and enjoying farming.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:10:00Z Started contract F07, mowing, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:18:00Z Finished mowing F07.
</p>

<p>
That was actually fun, field was not too big so went by fast and dunno why but grass baling work / contracts is always fun and relaxing. I would not do this for the money, canola and soybeans are for that, but grass mowing is fun, enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and exited FS22, I need to copy / reset autodrive paths and GPS lines to this savegame as there was nothing currently. Also took a quick restroom break.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:35:00Z Copied, now booting FS22 back up.
</p>

<p>
Now that I'm driving back from F07 to the dealership I'll record autodrive route, I am NOT going to use autodrive to DRIVE my vehicles as per official Start From Zero rules. But nobody said nothing about recording routes, doing courseplay field outlines or setting GPS lines, it is allowed as its not helping me to DRIVE any vehicles in any way (currently).
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:47:00Z Back at the dealership, dropped of mowers and picked up tedder, now a long drive back to F07 again...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T18:56:00Z Started tedding F07.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Last row.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T19:09:00Z Finished tedding grass to hay F07.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T19:17:00Z Arrived back to the dealership, I had autodrive route waypoints on to guide me but I drove the tractor myself, this way I didn't have to keep looking at the map. Hey it was not cheating, I drove the tractor myself! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Picked up baler and head back out to F07.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T19:26:00Z Started baling grass F07.
</p>

<p>
Baling was done without windrowing.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T20:03:00Z Finished baling grass F07.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2004.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2004.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
It took a while, didn't get bored yet but yeah it took a while... Now another long drive to the dealership, then back again with bale forks.
</p>

<p>
Delivery point is PMC Sell 05 selling point, this... this really scares me now, because all PMC terrain configs had a bug long time ago (relatively speaking) where silage bales contract was expecting delivery on regular selling point even though FS22 game engine only accepts silage / bales at animal dealer. I fixed that simply by adding animal dealer and removing grass, hay, silage etc crop types from the regular selling point.
</p>

<p>
So why is PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.2 still designating regular selling point to baling contract delivery point, hmm. And if this contract fails by the selling point not accepting these hay bales, what am I going to do then, fix the terrain and then somehow edit savegame XML files to add the money from this contract and cancel the contract? Hmm hmm. I really don't even want to think about such option now ... I am so hoping this would simply work...
</p>

<p>
BTW this story text is extremely difficult to write while driving a tractor on a curvy road, cant wait for my own land and vehicle so can use autodrive, courseplay and gps <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2021.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2021.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-21T20:21:00Z Arrived back at F07, forks or spiky and shit, lets collect four bales and then head over to PMC Sell 05.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2025.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2025.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-21T20:25:00Z All done, 4 bales spiked. Now off to another side of the terrain again.
</p>

<p>
Recording autodrive route while going down SW.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2029.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2029.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-21T20:39:00Z Arrived at PMC Sell 05 regular selling point, actually recorded autodrive route down in the SW tip of the terrain where this asphalt road was leading, just decided to do it as I was in the neighborhood. Maybe subconsiously that selling of grass bales was scaring me so much that if it fails... uuh hehe.
</p>

<p>
<i>That's a negative Ghostrider, the pattern is full.</i> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.2 still uses the broken ass selling point setup where grass, hay, silage etc is accepted in regular selling points which does not work in the game engine. SIGH <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game and shutdown FS22. I am going to immediately fix the selling points and compile v0.2.3 of this terrain. I assume the contract is not fixed automatically. Checked missions.xml file and there you have sellPointPlaceableId="5" property which indicates which selling point you deliver, if I could track down the animal dealer ID, I could simply swap those and continue with the contract. But even if its not possible, maybe I can somehow fake that I set the "deposited liters" value to high enough where contract is finished.
</p>

<p>
Its hand wavey borderline cheating, but it was my fault with the terrain bug in the first place dunno what else to do, well ok guess I could just cancel the contract and take the loss of time, hmm how long have I been playing now...
</p>

<p>
Anyways alarm went off is lunch time, I'll do the terrain fix first, then eat and well then continue.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T21:22:00Z Feeding done and PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.3 compiled, now starting to figure out how can I fix my savegame so the contract works.
</p>

<p>
Loaded the savegame up and unfortunately contracts were now all messed up with error:
</p>

<pre>
2022-09-21 21:26 Error: Running LUA method 'update'.
dataS/scripts/objects/SellingStation.lua(444) : attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value
</pre>

<p>
So I saved game in hopes that it would somehow reset the contracts with format it understands on next load. Restarted FS22 but no dice, same error comes up.
</p>

<p>
Erased missions.xml contents, hopefully that removes the error as it doesn't reference any selling points anymore.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T21:31:00Z Its fixed, but now all that work I did above is lost, like it never even happened, poof. Oh well, easy come, easy go.
</p>

<p>
Now lets continue and see if I run into any more bugs that set me back for two three hours <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T21:35:00Z Accepted contract harvesting wheat F08.
</p>

<p>
But... I got a problem. When I was entering the combine I spotted the baling contract equipment still on the dealership yard, so the contract disappeared but the tractor and equipment were still left behind. Ran to the baling contract field and it was "as is" all the bales still there, umm okay... Well this is troublesome, I think at this early in the savegame... its easier to just create band new savegame because nothing has really been done, its the easiest way to clear all the mess.
</p>


	<h2>New Savegame Created Using v0.2.3 Terrain Upgrade</h2>

<p>
2022-09-21T21:53:00Z Savegame created, did all the stuff mentioned in start of this story hehe. Then copied over autodrive and guidancestreeting XML files and just after doing that I realized... I now nuked the autodrive routes I did today. But luckily I still found them from savegame backup directory.
</p>

<p>
But on this savegame start... there is PLENTY of contracts, just not any small baling ones. Shortest harvest contract is one and a half hours which is quite rough start, but of course would get me going pretty nicely.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T22:04:00Z Accepted contract baling hay F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T22:14:00Z Arrived at F11, recorded autodrive route while driving there. Its far away, this contract will again take a while <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T22:18:00Z Started contract baling hay, mowing grass F11, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T22:21:00Z Finished mowing grass F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T22:53:00Z Been watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegrainarcade" target="_blank">twitch.tv/thegrainarcade</a> live stream and chatting a bit while playing, focus has been on playing but definitely that chatting has taken a bit of the time. I now need to focus completely to game-play hehe.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the dealership, picked up tedder and heading back out to F11 in the SE again.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:01:00Z Started tedding grass F11.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2302.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2302.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2306.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2306.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:06:00Z Finished tedding grass F11.
</p>

<p>
Then once again back to the dealership. Its questionable if windrowing saves time when you have to drive across 25% of the terrain width to get there, twice... but last time I took so long time to bale the all spread out flat hay that now I'm going to do that drive and windrow the hay.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:20:00Z Started windrowing hay F11.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:26:00Z Finished windrowing hay F11.
</p>

<p>
And again I'll drive back to the dealership <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:38:00Z Started baling hay F11.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2343.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-21T2343.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:46:00Z Finished baling hay F11.
</p>

<p>
And to the dealership.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-21T23:59:00Z Started to collect bales with the bale forks.
</p>

<p>
Off to deliver them into animal dealer.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0001.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0001.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Delivery point is fairly long ways ahead, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:06:00Z Arrived at animal dealer, drove to the dumping grate and opened bale forks. Bales went in, excellent!
</p>

<p>
Right away from the second two bales it said contract complete and I got 288 reward to my own pocket. Okay lets go grab and haul rest of the bales.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:15:00Z Second set of bales collected.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:19:00Z Bales dropped off at animal dealer, got about 1.4k per two bales so budget now 3.1k. Not sure if its profitable time use to go sell these 2.9k loads, but I'm going to do it anyways. Actually I don't think there are more than one load left, might even be just three bales left on the field, hmm, something like that.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:26:00Z Four bales on forks, last drop on my way.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:31:00Z Dropped off four bales to animal dealer, got 1.4k times two, budget now 6k. Yeah I would say these drops were not worth the time it took to do them. But at least I now have the satisfaction to know I did first contract properly.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:33:00Z Finished contract baling hay F11, collected reward 15.1k.
</p>

<p>
First contract complete! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Budget now 21.2k which is very nice starter kit for fertilizing or herbicide product when doing additional contracts.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:37:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F24. Borrowed vehicles were massey ferguson 8S.245 and bredal k165.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Then refilled spreader.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T00:42:00Z Started contract fertilizing F24, manually driving. I'm using the good old minimap 9 compass to guide my tractor, I just set it to 0/180 heading and off I go. Only thing needs careful aiming is those turns and of course keeping it on 0 or 180 heading.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0047.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0047.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-22T01:18:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F24, collected reward 45.6k after first driving tractor to the dealer and unloading solid fertilizer.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking if I should purchase spreader so I could just load it up and only use borrowed tractor from contract, but seeing the absolutely insane fertilizing contracts list, its basically one max two contracts and I can buy my own tractor as well.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0130.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-22T0130.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-22T01:32:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F17. Same type vehicle borrow, bredal k165.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k. Then refilled bredal k165.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T01:47:00Z Started contract fertilizing F17, manually driving.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I started reading FS17 Cornbelt From Scratch (start from scratch) and finished it today, differences from 2018 october to today's Start From Zero's is that 2018 missions paid much more and were sort of easier to do (auto refill on combine grain tank and slurry spreader etc, grain tanks never got full and slurry etc tanks never ran empty) and that vehicle prices I believe were cheaper, also soybeans etc crop prices were MUCH higher, but that of course comes only after you start to buy your own vehicles and land.
</p>

<p>
Overall I feel like things were easier back in FS17, in my above linked story I buy my first land (field at the time) and vehicles after the SEVENTH mission, in FS19 and FS22 I can do at least dozen contracts before even dreaming of buying land.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T02:36:00Z Oops forgot to write that I went for a lunch break, just returned and now fertilizing continues.
</p>

<p>
Now I have 5hrs and 1min of today left before 17hrs been awake alarm goes off, no idea how insomnia I feel today if I can push further out, right now I'm super excited and feeling good, but we'll see how things are in 5 hours from now ...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T02:50:00Z Was ALT-TABbed to chat in penalty_box's twitch live stream... and my tractor drove off the terrain edge and I had to reset it, weight and bredal k165 to the shop, which made 6.4k liters of solid fertilizer disappear <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T03:10:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F17, drove tractor to the dealership, unloaded bredal k165, collected reward 88.5k.

I am not complaining... but this is just crazy good money I'm getting now from these contracts, yes sure its been several hours of working and I now have 109.6k budget, so yes its fair that I get something from all these hours spent working... but somehow... not sure how exactly, I kind of feel like... maan, this is like taking a candy from a baby when I'm looking at those HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS reward fertilizing or harvesting contracts right now.

<p>
2022-09-22T04:48:00Z Finished contract fertilizing F22, drove back to the dealership and unloaded amazone, collected reward 79.3k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 172.7k.
</p>

<p>
Been eyeballing those cheapo vehicles and equipment. This is the list I came up with so far:
</p>

<pre>
33.5k seeder 125hp nordsten hk 25
25k grain header 5m rostselmash power stream 500
75k combine 4.9k liters rostselmash nova 330
96.5k tractor 135hp valtra a series
23k trailer 18.5k liters brantner z 18051/2 xxl power flex
===
253k
</pre>

<p>
Wow that is like way above our price range. Hmm that makes me sad...
</p>

<p>
Lets think about fertilizer spreader contract purchase:
</p>

<pre>
54.4k spreader 18m 18km/h 14k liters bredal k105
108.5k tractor 150hp fendt 500 favorit
===
162.9k
</pre>

<p>
Yup that pretty much settles it, I'm going to buy that contractor fertilizer spreader setup so I can use autodrive, courseplay and GPS while doing some money before starting our own farm. <i>Edit: sigh NO. Unless you also buy LAND you are violating Start From Zero rules by using automation tools!</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T05:01:00Z Purchased the above contractor setup, my very first vehicles! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Purchased 5 big bags of solid fertilizer for 9.1k, budget now 751 hehe. Refilled bredal k105 but it only got 12032 liters 85% full, oh well more after the next contract is done.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T05:05:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F06, F08 and F21.

<b>ATTENTION!</b> <i>2024-01-16T07:37:00Z Edit: umm what the fuck happened here, I bought vehicles (no land) and immediately started to use automation tools which is against original Start From Zero rules? This must have been some brain fart oversight on my part, I specifically mentioned in the beginning of this story page that I had previous PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero which was cheaty using money making placeables so I deleted it, yet here again I'm "cheating" by going against rules. Sucks. Not sure what to do here as in 2024 this savegame has now already grown so large (I have like over 10 million in cash and huge fleet of vehicles) that deleting this savegame and AGAIN beginning from zero would be really silly, its not like I'm some lying bitch ass cheater repeat offender, this was simply a brain fart, I forgot the specific land purchase rule. Its fucked up but what can ya do.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: 2024-02-16T02:06:00Z another proof read while adding screenshots as well is going on now, funny that its exactly one month after the above one. Anyways. Right now I feel that in order to set a good example for others and have no shame on ridiculing cheaters, I think this savegame must be deleted as well no matter how many hundreds of hours I ended up MISTAKENLY putting it. This really sucks, it feels like being a child who was told that Santa Clause is not real. But either you follow rules or you live as scumbag lowlife cheater. Its strange that I don't actually mind the game-play I would have to go through to reach the point this savegame is today (2024-02-16), but its this story and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pmcsince1984/search?query=%22pmc%20super%20six%206km%20start%20from%20zero%22" target="_blank">several 45min episodes of videos (overview + 7 episodes)</a> I captured, edited, rendered and uploaded to youtube at that time, all that stuff would go to waste and I would end up with yet another "UNOFFICIAL" Start From Zero story, also because youtube sucks so bad, there are now episodes from this savegame like S01E01, if I make the "REAL PROPER" savegame, then how do anyone tell its S01E01 apart from the one that has now already been released. Oh man what a MESS, I hate this situation. HMPH!</i>

<p>
Whee its happening, our very first own vehicle and driving with GPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
It feels good to be on the field with your own vehicle, but at the same time I'm a little bit disappointed that I went through this route... which is purchasing contractor fertilize spreader setup first instead of getting own land and small seeder + combine. I didn't have the money for it and yeah well decided to get this seeding tractor.
</p>

<p>
This fendt 500 favorit surely will pull a small seeder and grain trailer so this was not useless purchase. Greed is a threat, once I finish these three contracts I have over 100k more money again, so its easy to be lured with temptation of easy money and do more contracts and more and more ... you know the deal. What about that small farming on your own land... yeah dunno, we're just doing contracts heh. Nah, that's no good, I need to buy our first land, the small equipment or what I can afford, then start to work the field.

</p>

<p>
According to better contracts estimate I should just barely have enough solid fertilizer for this field.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T05:56:00Z Well guess the fertilizer wont last now, I made a wrong direction turn in last pass, fertilized same pass second time just noticed at the end hehe. I've been browsing dealership menu with P key and just turn tractor at the end, guess my mind wasn't on the job, dumb move dude <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
<i>Edit: repeat offender of Start From Zero rules. No good. OK OK I wont tease you with repeating this anymore, I made my point.</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T06:51:00Z Getting a bit tired, yawning, still completely fine to farm but wont take long now before need to call it a night.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-22T06:59:00Z Oh man, just realized huge mistake in this savegame... Start From Zero old school FS17 Cornbelt rules state that manual driving until you purchase land and vehicle... well I have NOT purchased land but already doing third field with GPS. What a fuckup <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well, its not like its a crime or cheating, but yeah this is a major bummer for me, I am really disappointed in myself now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
In my defense, I have been doing this setup for dozens of times in FS19 and FS22 now, its like muscle memory that once you buy a vehicle you get to use GPS. <i>Edit: excuses are like assholes, everyones got one...</i>

2022-09-22T07:07:00Z Drove to the dealership, refilled last big bags of solid fertilizer to bredal k105, saved game and shutdown FS22, its time to call it a night, I can still do couple of computer chores before going to bed, nites.
