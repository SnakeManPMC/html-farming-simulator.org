	<h2>2021-12-14 Nvidia GTX 1060 Crash Testing</h2>

<p>
2021-12-14T18:46:00Z New farming day has started, Nvidia GTX 1060 3gb GPU is now in, lets see if there is more crashes with nvidia 497.09 drivers.
</p>

<p>
Had to drop 4k details down to medium, still kind of sluggish at 35FPS or so. I really dont want to turn video settings more lower as it starts to look so crappy, but hey I might have to, there is no excuse for lower than 30FPS.
</p>

<p>
Started this savegame back up again, replaced The Well mod with Parzival's Water Production mod, sold the old water tanks and bought one new, saved game, deleted The Well mod and restarted game.
</p>

<p>
Recap for myself mostly as its been several days since I played: I now own all the farmland which has fields in them. Plan is to harvest all the fields and then this savegame is finished.
</p>

<p>
First I'm going to make a list of field numbers which I've already harvested.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T19:18:00Z Purchased warehouse to store my production chain products, activated lettuce and in greenhouses set lettuce to distribution.
</p>

<p>
Then it was time to start seeding some oats to few of the new fields.
</p>

<p>
Sold john deere 7R 350 because I hate as its so short-body and awkward to drive. Purchased new seeding tractor new holland t8.435 genesis with michelin twin wheels and GPS for 365k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 152.6k, but what does it matter as I own all the farmland? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T19:31:00Z Started to seed oats to F30-F34.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T19:51:00Z Lunch break, left tractor running on the field while I'm eating.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T20:27:00Z Feeding time over, back to farming.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2044.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2044.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2021-12-14T20:49:00Z Ran out of seeds, as I'm so close to the vehicle shop I'll just drive there to refill from the many big bags laying on the shop yard.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T21:08:00Z Finished seeding oats, did it mostly on in-cab view looking around with mouse as TrackIR5 is not connected, need to plug it in and restart the game.
</p>

<p>
Started fertilize spraying F30-F34.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T21:25:00Z Finished fertilizing F30-F34. Saved game, first time in hours, GTX 1060 3gb still running strong.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated to the next day/month and weeds grew, as usual.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T21:50:00Z Started herbicide spraying F30-F34.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2154.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2154.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2021-12-14T22:05:00Z Finished herbicide spraying F30-F34.
</p>

<p>
As its now soybeans planting season I'm going to start attacking the northern fields which I have never harvested before. Took fendt 1050 vario, hooked up kinze 4905 blue drive, refilled seeds and drove to the first small field.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2208.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-14T2208.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2021-12-14T22:27:00Z Finished seeding soybeans to F26-F29.
</p>

<p>
F20 and F21 are locked behind a fence and vegetation that I cannot drive combines there, so while the goal is to harvest all fields it doesnt mean I need to buy tiny combine to get into some stupid small fields. I am going to skip these fields.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T22:32:00Z Started seeding soybeans to F22.<br>
2021-12-14T22:35:00Z Finished.<br>
2021-12-14T22:37:00Z Started seeding soybeans to F23 and F24.<br>
2021-12-14T22:42:00Z Finished.
</p>

<p>
Next was the far NE corner F12-F19.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T22:57:00Z Finished. Decided to leave oats and soybeans planting season here, there are still fields to harvest in NW corner but why not push it, lets take this central to NE area now, rest next year.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-14T23:01:00Z Saved game and shut down FS22, enough playing for today, will continue tomorrow most likely so perhaps I could do roughly 12 hour gaming session and if there is no crashes at that point then its fairly safe to say GTX TITAN X is broken and this GTX 1060 3gb works stable (although with low video preset settings).
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T02:30:00Z Well, did not call it a night, just watched few tv show episodes and still didn't feel like sleeping, then my favorite twitch streamers went live so grabbed a bite to eat and switched to PMC Gaming computer, lets continue farming and GTX 1060 testing.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated few days and monitored the new warehouse mod, it seems to "steal" my flour from bakery, hmm. Not sure how to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
Oats and canola are ready to harvest, yeah got one canola field in the north when purchasing the farmland. Its time to harvest.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T02:49:00Z Started harvesting oats.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T03:26:00Z Saw demco 2200 grain cart for sale in -44% so bought it for 63.6k.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-15T0340.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Elmcreek-2021-12-15T0340.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Elmcreek Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2021-12-15T04:09:00Z Finished harvesting oats, just need to haul the grain into farm yard.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T04:32:00Z Finished hauling oats to grain mill, its now processing 185k liters.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated to the next day aug.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T04:37:00Z Started harvesting canola F11.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T04:54:00Z Finished and already dumped canola in farm grain bin.
</p>

<p>
2021-12-15T04:59:00Z Had to call it a night, for real this time, was dead tired could not keep my eyes open. But at least I got half of the harvest season done which was pretty nice.
