	<h2>Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km</h2>

<p>
2022-04-23T14:54:34Z Welcome to Start From Zero <a href="https://afb-mapping.itch.io/fs22-spring-creek-12km" target="_blank">FS22 Spring Creek 12km</a> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I actually checked this terrain out couple of hours ago, started new farmer career and saved game, I reset money to 0 with gsMoneyAdd and new farmer game-mode did not include any vehicles so that was good, also no loan, so its all zeroes now.
</p>

<p>
This Start From Zero is quite... not exactly a joke but pretty close, because this terrain is frigging 12.2km which means huge. Previously today I played on <a href="stories-start-from-zero-elmcreek.php">Start From Zero Elmcreek</a> and it was boring as hell, now I just somehow came across Spring Creek which <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=12324" target="_blank">ARG_Afb</a> sent to me couple of days ago. Then on PMC Farming discord we chatted and dunno after thinking about it a bit I decided to try if start from zero would work in such a big terrain.
</p>

<p>
Obviously it <i>"works"</i>, I've done it in <a href="../19/pmc-grande-gardens-16km.php">PMC Grande Gardens 16km</a> which is several kilometers bigger than Spring Creek, but dunno it might be difficult to get started depending on field sizes and available contracts.
</p>

<p>
Let's give it a try and document what happens <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'm using the new fs22 better contracts mod which I have to admit is pretty awesome, it lists all kinds of cool stuff and allows you to filter contracts to minimize the clutter in the list.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to start by filtering profit per minute which is lame but lets see if I could find some small/quick contracts. Actually that filter doesn't show quick contracts but yeah anyways.
</p>

<p>
But whoah when starting to browse those contracts, there was just huge number of them as this terrain has over 300, I think close to 400 fields and smallest contract I found was harvesting for 0.8ha field, heh that is already too small, not worth the time to drive vehicles up to the field, need to find something a bit more lucrative <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
There is a problem though, no easy way to check how far a field is from dealership, hell I don't even know where dealership is heh, so you might take a decent contract but have to drive 10km to the field, per vehicle! heh thats not very fun. Anyways gotta take something. <i>Edit: later I suggested this feature to designate fields which have available and your contracts in them to FS22 Better Contracts developer and he was gracious enough to add such feaure, awesome.</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T15:09:23Z Accepted harvesting contract for F267 with borrowed vehicles for 7.9k.
</p>

<p>
And immediately I started to drive combine to the wrong direction <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Field distance from dealership was not that far, was pretty close actually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1515.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1515.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-23T15:17:26Z Arrived to the field and I do consider this to be <i>"close by"</i> heh, you really get that sense that <i>"We are not in kansas anymore..."</i> when comparing to the piece of crap useless elmcreek 2km little girlie men terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T15:18:28Z Started harvesting F267, contract.
</p>

<p>
As soon as combine header hit the canola field, I started to get this spam in the game log:
</p>

<pre>
2022-04-23 15:19 DensityMapModifier: masks must either be scaled up or scaled down in both directions - mask size 16384x16384, mask2 size 4096x4096 and density map size 8192x8192 are incompatible
</pre>

<p>
Had to restart game after headland was done because terrain spams that error constantly in the log and keeps dev console open as I had that turned on in game.xml settings, disabled that feature and then restarted game back up again, now I'm oblivious for horrible error spam in the log <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T15:38:56Z Combine almost full, driving case 380 with grain trailer now to the field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1538.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1538.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-23T15:56:00Z Finished harvesting F267, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1556.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1556.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Now just need to unload combine, hopefully everything fits into the trailer and then haul for sell. Uh oh 1077 liters were left in the combine, depending how painful the drive into the selling point is, I might not return to pick them up, just not worth it.
</p>

<p>
After I set off driving towards north where the selling point is, it was clear to me I am so not going to pick up the last 1077 liters hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T16:12:46Z Reached the selling well err delivery point, dumped 18k some liters, but contract notification said 94% transported, huh can the remaining 1077 liters really consist of six percent? Hmm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1612.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1612.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
But after I typed the above paragraph, then new notification came that contract 99% complete and same reads in the contract menu, aargh. I have to drive all the way back to the combine to pickup that measily 1k liters hehe. But now, I'm starvin'...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T16:14:26Z Lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T16:41:11Z Feeding time over, lets go pickup the 1k liters of canola <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1644.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1644.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-23T17:05:16Z Okay massive 1077 liters of canola hauled from F267 to the delivery point, contract complete. Collected reward 7.4k whohoo <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
There is just crazy amounts of contracts available in this terrain, awesome. Filtered only fertilizing contracts and picked one for F137 with borrowed vehicles for 13.8k. Hopefully I have enough money for the fertilizer product purchase.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 4 bags of fertilizer for 7.2k.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1712.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1712.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And goodness gracious F137 is other side of the terrain haha. Oh well, lets start to drive there <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1722.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1722.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-04-23T17:28:52Z Arrived to the field, finally hehe. Now need to take a restroom break.
</p>

<p>
That field looks so huge, hopefully 4k liters of solid fertilizer is enough heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T17:38:25Z Started fertilizing F137, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T17:51:34Z Finished fertilizing F137, contract.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1751.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1751.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
I had 2.5k liters of fertilizer left in bredal spreader, but I decided to just collect the contract now without emptying bredal, I'm actually getting money back from the fertilizer. I don't like this method, it feels like cheating, fill up a tank to the brim, do the contract and just collect reward getting money back from the product, never having the need to worry about emptying etc.
</p>

<p>
With the reimbursement of 2.5k liters fertilizer, collected contract reward of 16.5k, budget now 18.5k. Ah this is nice budget to buy some product and take more contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:01:44Z Accepted contract spraying herbicide on F335 with borrowed rubicon 9000, for 52.5k. Better contracts says usage 8.2k liters and cost of material 9.9k, lets hope its right.
</p>

<p>
Bought seven tanks for herbicide.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1803.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-Spring-Creek-12km-2022-04-23T1803.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero Spring Creek 12km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
And again F335 is about half across the terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:15:29Z Arrived at the field hehe, wow that was a long drive <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:16:04Z Started herbicide spraying F335, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:32:56Z Finished herbicide spraying F335, contract.
</p>

<p>
Was really tough to navigate this field because I could not see anything and mapview was not very accurate either, had to use all my experience and knowledge of farmsim playing to get it done. When finished I had 1.2k liters of herbicide left.
</p>

<p>
Now instead of collecting reward and returning the vehicle, I'm going to filter more spraying contracts and see if there is some small field nearby I could do before returning to the vehicle shop for a refill.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:38:18Z Accepted contract herbicide spraying F356 for 3.8k reward. This field was on my way to the dealership, perfect.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:42:57Z Started herbicide spraying F356, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:44:29Z Finished herbicide spraying F356, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:46:34Z Accepted contract herbicide spraying F359, for 8.4k.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:47:28Z Started spraying herbicide F359, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:48:47Z ... but ran out of herbicide <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Back to the dealership we go.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T18:55:34Z Arrived to dealership for a refill heh.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 4k liters of herbicide, then ran out of money <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:06:36Z Finished contract on F359.
</p>

<p>
Accepted bunch of contracts nearby, too lazy to type them all down, they were 300-370 range <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:12:16Z Started spraying herbicide F351, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:17:23Z Finished contract on F351.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:18:49Z Started spraying herbicide F349, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:21:57Z Finished contract on F349.
</p>

<p>
Forgot to write, sprayed F342.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:35:31Z Finished contract on F337.
</p>

<p>
While driving back to the dealership, I accepted ALL remaining spraying contracts <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:51:46Z Purchased 10k liters of herbicide, refilled rubicon 9000.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T19:59:07Z Finished contract on F251.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T20:02:05Z Finished contract on F249.
</p>

<p>
Next was F248 which is close to dealership (refills) and it is one huge field. The problem is that its growing plants and nowhere to tell where you have sprayed earlier, in the 3d world, in 2d mapview you can tell but its such a hassle to check from there.
</p>

<p>
Going to restart game and change settings a bit, increase texture quality in hopes that it will give details for the mapview.
</p>

<p>
Changed in-game texture quality to high and view/lod distance in game.xml to 3. But apparently texture quality is not what controls how detailed mapview is, hmm ok. Oh well we continue.
</p>

<p>
So the problem is this huge field and how to see where have I sprayed already, guess I just have to check the blurry mapview.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T20:14:14Z Started spraying herbicide F248, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T20:22:37Z Ran out of juice, back to the dealership for a refill.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another 10k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T20:50:11Z Ran out of herbicide again, another refill.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another 8k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T21:11:17Z Again ran out of herbicide heh.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another 10k liters of herbicide.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T21:20:55Z Finished contract on F248.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T21:23:49Z Started spraying herbicide F252, contract.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T21:29:30Z Finished contract on F252.
</p>

<p>
And then it was time to call it a night, already been a long day and dead tired. Maybe continue tomorrow as I just got new version from ARG_Afb.
</p>

<p>
2022-04-23T21:32:50Z Shut down FS22, nites.
