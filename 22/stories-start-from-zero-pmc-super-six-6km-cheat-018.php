	<h2>2023-01-28 Second Day Of Harvest Season</h2>

<p>
2023-01-28T10:53:00Z New farming day has started, today's goal is very simple, finish F16, F17, F18, F19 and F49 soybeans harvests. Just woke up, brushed quickly through morning computer chores only touching the most important news / items, have not eat days first meal yet, made sure there is enough free HDD space in editing computer and started my OBS captured MP4 file robocopy /MOVE commant batch file, there are 32.4gb of MP4 video clips from yesterday so will take a moment to copy those over.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 187hrs 59min on it.
</p>

<p>
Going to go through these harvests in clockwise movement, so it means fields 19, 16, 17, 18 and last is the smallish 49. Just moved F19 to be the first on the list from my fields-todo alphabetical list.
</p>

<p>
These are fairly large fields (except F49), and there are empty farm yard right smack in the middle of them where I'm planning on purchasing one of those big honking grain bin silos, so delivering grain to the silo is no problem this time and field shapes are so traditional style almost (almost) a square box shape so should make nice fast courseplay work.
</p>

<p>
Robocopy MP4 file /MOVE bat finished, it was surprisingly fast copy or maybe I got distracted by this story writing and checking out fields in fs22, then I launched OBS as I forgot to do that in the first place, but when I clicked back to fs22 ... it had frozen, it was simply in mapview and froze, must be some win10 + OBS + game issue. Okay task manager kill the fs22 task and lets try again...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T11:08:00Z OBS and fs22 re-started, back in-game. Everything seems to run smooth.
</p>

<p>
Okay so recap from last night; oct 1st in-game 1542hrs, I can sense the disgusting dawn / dusk glow starting to appear slowly, sure I'll have hours left in the day but today I have to time accelerate. Budget 10.742m. Soybeans in farm yard F39 S bin and farm yard F11 bin total of 1.644m liters.
</p>

<p>
Started by driving combines across F39 to F19 W edge, could have sent them with autodrive for the long way along roads, but there are utility poles in the first asphalt road so might have gotten stuck in those and I own F39 which is withered so I can drive across such field.
</p>

<p>
Combine harvesters look like they are about 50% diesel fuel, so grabbed semi-truck with UTTS-32000 liquid tanker trailer with diesel fuel and refueled harvesters, fendt 1050 vario grain cart tractor and all semi-trucks.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T11:28:00Z All vehicles parked by F19 W, saved game and hit the pause button, I usually never use pause in farmsim because it feels so odd and I heard stories that in FS19 it will break Seasons mod, but now I'm on the in-game day getting late afternoon and I need to grab a days first meal (real life haha) so its good to not waste any in-game time while eating.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T11:57:00Z Feeding time is over, lets start today's first harvest. Uh that meal was painful to do while farmsim was paused on the screen, felt such a waste of perfectly good farming time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T11:59:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F19, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 1hrs 20min. Not too bad duration, nice size field.
</p>

<p>
Another day of harvesting...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1209.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1209.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T12:32:00Z All harvesters did the courseplay victory loop around the headland for no good reason. I still haven't learned how to select course generation starting position and settings to prevent this, it is extremely frustrating seeing combines driving around headland doing nothing with 25km/h speed (max field speed), yeah I get it they are driving to the exit / inner rows starting point, but uuh its so painful to watch and pure waste of time, there have to be better option for this <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Here they finished victory loop and started inner rows.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1235.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1235.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Hmm I need to study that and find settings that prevent or at least minimize the driving distance, because on large fields (mostly large terrains as there are only few legit 2km terrains with LARGE fields), this useless victory loop can sometimes take over 10min. Its such a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T13:26:00Z Feeling good about today's farming session so far, courseplay has not fucked up too bad yet and everything seems to be running as expected. Hopefully this lasts long and I'm getting enjoyable farming day.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T13:30:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F19. And now restroom break.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T13:43:00Z Purchased AGI flat bottom bin + neco dryer for 220k, this gives me 5.432m liters capacity. Placed it on farm yard F19 SE. This will be my today's remaining and future as well, main grain silo location, it will definitely hold all the soybeans grain coming out of the remaining fields.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T13:51:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F16, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 1hrs. Another hour field work, lets hope this goes by without issues, nicely.
</p>

<p>
Getting late.
</p>

<p>
Yes! Found the good spot to end headland <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1417.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1417.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Now hopefully in the future I can avoid the stupid victory loops with careful selection of field work starting location.
</p>

<p>
Sunset harvesting.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1427.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1427.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1439.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1439.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T14:59:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F16. Oops forgot to write this timestamp down heh, so harvesters finished field work, then I unloaded them into grain cart, unloaded grain cart to agi farm yard F19 SE bin silo, shut all vehicles down and time accelerated until morning daylight.
</p>

<p>
Oct 2nd in-game 0739hrs gooood moooorning PMC Super Six 6km! Rise and shine time to harvest some soybeans! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Claas lexion 8900s were about half a tank of fuel, so called up semi-truck with diesel tanker trailer and fueled them up. Then took care to courseplay generate field work course which has no useless victory lap after headland, got it done nicely. I'm learning new things. From now on I'll make sure all headland field work courses have the inner row start after starting point.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T15:08:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F17, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 50min.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1544.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1544.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T16:37:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F17. Oops, I got caught chatting with JTSage about ProductionInspector giving me an error, appears there was a bug fix just for my issue only 17hrs ago which I updated and now produciton inspector works OK.
</p>

<p>
This was actually demo screenshot for JTSage to show it works, lets put it here as well heh.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1619.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1619.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T16:42:00Z And now its my lunch break again, actually pretty good timing when you think about it, harvest one field just finished.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T17:12:00Z Feeding time is over, off to the next soybeans field.
</p>

<p>
Oops I actually missed a spot on the field when cancelling courseplay field work course, but it was 2m wide streak of crop so finished that off manually.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T17:19:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F18, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 1hrs 34min. Last bigger field.
</p>

<p>
Then again courseplay bugged, fourth combine would not, I say again, would not start its course at first waypoint, no matter what I tried it shoot off to second headland, no idea why <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
So I let him go for second headland start, it is what it its, win10 + fs22 + courseplay-gui sucks.
</p>

<p>
New F19 S grain trailer loading point for autodrive.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1735.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T1735.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T18:23:00Z Fourth combine harvester just absolutely will not start a right(2) lane course, so I had to start manually harvesting driving that vehicle <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I would like to have one farming day without courseplay fucking up, just ONE (1) day, please <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Other combines were full, waiting, while I was driving this fourth lane. Hmm this course is bugged more ways than one, for example second vehicle does not respect vehicle convoy distance, it just speeds past lead vehicle when it stops to unload into grain cart, its not detecting it, which means either second and third vehicles are on some "other lane" or lead vehicle is in some "oblivion lane", just weird bugged crappy field work course. And how could I have detected something like this from the courseplay-gui crap, I couldn't. Sigh.
</p>

<p>
Second combine considers himself the first, it made that 95% tank full cutting pocket thing for me. Very very weird. This field is going to be suffering through and through <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T19:12:00Z Courseplay fucked up again, combines collided head on, sigh, a deep sigh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Today started with a good mood, was feeling great just hour or so ago when getting new fixed product inspector and improved simple inspector after discussion with JTSage, but now... courseplay fails flat on its face, AGAIN... I am just grasping the straws to keep myself of shutting this shit down and doing something more enjoyable <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I have no fucking idea where the fuck these combines are now supposed to go, none, zip, nada, ZERO! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T19:16:00Z Combines clipped the end tips of headers, luckily they did not mangle themselves all over each other, that was a little too close...
</p>

<p>
I should probably drive reminder of this field manually with GPS, just to avoid further frustrating myself with this crap...
</p>

<p>
Courseplay-gui is simply not capable of doing complex irregular shape fields, give it a box rectangle shape field and no problemos, but anything irregular, the more irregular and the worse it gets. Argh.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T19:33:00Z Next slimey little cocksucking combine "left the course, stopped". I am ready to rage quit and go back to FS19 editing and playing, man would it be wonderful to be in PMC Iowa Garden City 8km with proper FS19 Seasons mod, with actual temperatures etc, wow...
</p>

<p>
I'm going to try psychological warfare, I'm unloading grain cart and then go take a shower, no not a cold one but just a shower, maybe that few minutes away from fs22 courseplay-gui shit and splashing water to my face eases my mind, dunno, otherwise I am pretty much done playing this shit here...
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T19:52:00Z Came back from shower, obviously two fucking combines were mangled on each other, so much for the shower idea to cool down... sigh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was thinking that win10 + fs22 + courseplay-gui + irregular shape fields == clusterfuck.
</p>

<p>
Give courseplay a box shape and multiples of tool size field and there will be no problems. Especially those diagonally oriented irregular shape fields like F38 and this F18 are a fucking nightmare for courseplay-gui.
</p>

<p>
Note to myself; read and document above infuriating rage causing courseplay + irregular shape diagonal fields info. Do not never ever create fields of that shape in any farmsim game, ever.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T20:02:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F18. Finally this horror was over <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T20:08:00Z Started harvesting soybeans F49, courseplay 4x tools, ETA 27min.
</p>

<p>
Initially I thought to use only 2 combines, but once course was generated I saw the size of this field and while its not a very large... its enough to justify more vehicles than just 2, so generated course for 4 combines making sure there is no useless victory loop after headland. And seeing how it takes 27min with 4 * 18.2m tools, it was pretty decent choice.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T20:25:00Z Aand guess what?
</p>

<p>
I give you three guesses?
</p>

<p>
Come you! you know this?
</p>

<p>
Okay last hint, its the C WORD!
</p>

<p>
Right! Yeah courseplay fucked up, *AGAIN*, combines collided head on. SIIIIIIGH NNNGGGGHH! GRRRR! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_evil.gif" alt="Smiley :evil:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
It is truly astonishing why have I not rage quit yet, why am I still playing this courseplay-gui garbage.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T20:41:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans F49.
</p>

<p>
That's it, its a wrap, soybeans harvest season is over, "whohoo", yeah no big grin smiley here I am so disappointed and frustrated by courseplay-gui garbage that I just don't have the happy face mood here, sorry.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive sent last grain loads into farm yard F19 SE AGI flat bottom bin + neco dryer, then rest of the semi-trucks into farm yard F11 parking, same as fendt 1050 vario grain cart tractor.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T2049.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T2049.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
As soon as these guys park then its savegame and shutdown time for me.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T2049-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2023-01-28T2049-2.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km CHEAT Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2023-01-28T20:54:00Z Fendt 1050 vario and all semi-trucks parked at farm yard F11, combines as mentioned will remain on the F49 as usual heh.
</p>

<p>
Farm yard F11 grain bin silo has 527.5k liters of soybeans, farm yard F39 S has 1.550m liters and farm yard F19 SE has 1.471m liters. Soybeans total in the farm 3.549m liters.
</p>

<p>
Hmm that is surprising, my previous harvest season which felt like smaller size than this one got me 4.1m liters if I recall correctly, oh well guess it was bigger harvest then.
</p>

<p>
Okay so I am going to call it a night for PMC Super Six 6km Start From Zero now, I start to actually feel pretty good after accomplishing this task of full harvest season, got vehicles parked away etc, but yeah I am still pissed off to courseplay-gui crap and there is noway in hell I would start another planting season preparations now. I'm off to sort out, edit and encode all the videos I captured, plus other things I've neglected during today's farming / gaming session.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I'll be returning to fs22 anytime soon, I mean sure I would kind of like to try some massive 216ha field harvest on PMC Cereal Region 32km, but maybe its just a dumb idea of mine and when you actually started to do something like that it would get frustrating and horribly boring real quick, imagine the amount of grain cart driving on a field like that heh wow.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, no specific message for when I'm returning to this savegame next time, everything is pretty nicely going, have money, have soybeans, what more can you ask, its a good place to start the next planting season.
</p>

<p>
2023-01-28T21:02:00Z Saved game and shutdown fs22, goodbye, for now...
</p>
