	<h2>2022-05-22 Soybeans Harvest Season Begins</h2>

<p>
2022-05-22T04:26:00Z New farming day has started, this savegame now has 108hrs 2min on it. Broke the magical triple digits limit <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Todays goal is to finish planting season, for sure, then start harvest season and ... dunno if have enough hours in a day to finish it, hopefully.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T04:29:00Z Started herbicide spraying field N-NE, four fields.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T05:07:00Z Another rubicon refill done and semi-truck liquid tanker trailer empty, sending tanker back to the dealership for its refill. Hell with this rate we run out of cash before this planting season is over <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Autodrive got semi-truck to the dealership where I topped it off with 32k liters of herbicide for 38.4k, budget now 111.9k.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T05:13:00Z Finished herbicide spraying field N-NE.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T05:14:00Z Started herbicide spraying field... next to the last one hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T05:33:00Z Finished herbicide spraying field... next to the last one.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T05:34:00Z Started herbicide spraying field E of shop, the last field!
</p>

<p>
Now I actually feel positive about savegame progress, day is very early for me I'm practically still finishing up my days first meal, so there is many many hours left in this day. Its done deal that I'll get harvest season started within hour and who knows hopefully manage to finish harvesting all fields, hard to say there is a lot of soybeans to cut with 18.2m header, hopefully I can keep the combine running constantly when I'm driving grain cart tractor and autodrive handles semi-truck grain trailer hauling. If autodrive fails, well then we are back in square one with the time use as I have to drive all the grain hauling myself.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, still a good stuff going on today <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T06:09:00Z Finished herbicide spraying field E of shop. Did the last row strip manually with boom spray width control narrow.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive both vehicles to the dealership, refueled semi-truck so its good to go for big grain hauling in upcoming harvest season, repaired it as well with vehicleexplorer ALT-R feature. Parked rubicon as its offline until the next planting season begins and that is far far in the future both in-game and especially in real life heh.
</p>

<p>
Then drove fendt 942 vario + kinze 1051 grain cart to the dealership, refueled and repaired it as well. Was thinking of driving them already to the W field but nah, lets keep vehicles by the dealership it feels much more like proper thing to do.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T06:17:00Z Now starts time accelerating until harvest season arrives.
</p>

<p>
As all field work is done, yield-bonus +85% now.
</p>

<p>
Heh grow, grow <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Alright oct 1st in-game 0740hrs, good morning soybeans fields, harvest season has arrived <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Sent all harvest fleet vehicles to W of shop field, but for some odd reason claas lexion 8900 combine was not refueled, so I did that and drove it myself as I don't have a header trailer and wrapping header around a utility pole or a tree is not my idea of good fun.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T06:43:00Z Started harvesting soybeans field W of shop.
</p>

<p>
Once semi-truck grain trailer was full 40k liters of soybeans autodrive started to drive it towards the dealership where farm bin silo is, now just lets hope it doesn't come back from that trip still full of grain...
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T07:19:00Z And of course autodrive failed, it did not dump grain load to the farm bin silo <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T07:58:00Z Finally managed to get autodrive tracks sorted so grain trailer actually dumps into farm bin silo. Although on those northern fields distance to the dealership gets a bit long, it might be borderline if truck can keep up with grain cart driving in non-stop loop, will be interesting to see.
</p>

<p>
When such time comes that we purchase second combine, it requires second grain truck or mother bin.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T08:41:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field W of shop.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T08:44:00Z Started harvesting soybeans field NW of shop.
</p>

<p>
The View.

<p>
2022-05-22T09:22:00Z Lunch break, I'll let combine fill up and then just wait until I'm done eating.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T09:46:00Z Feeding time is over, back to harvesting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Waiting ...
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T11:35:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field NW of shop.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T11:38:00Z Started harvesting soybeans field NW tip of shop.
</p>

<p>
Claas lexion 8900 is probably 20% fuel state now, heh hmm wonder how am I going to refuel it, drive all the way to the dealership and back or buy some fuel tank trailer, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Autodrive for semi-truck grain trailer has been so far doing pretty good job now that I fixed the tracks and target location for the farm bin silo, it just simply works. Its really slow, but just fast enough to handle grain volume from this one lexion 8900.
</p>

<p>
This are rolling pretty smoothly now, no real issues. I have somewhat time on my hands while waiting for combine tank to fill up, most of the time I empty it when its over 50%.
</p>

<p>
One side done, just starting on the other side of the road.
</p>

<p>
By the farm yard, hello neighbor.

<p>
Field is cut open, slice and dice.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T12:09:00Z Farm bin silo has now 566k liters of soybeans <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its good that I left some money to our budget, looks like we're gonna need it to buy more silo extensions before this harvest is over hehe.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T13:03:00Z Claas lexion 8900 combine is out of fuel, just barely visible red flashing bar on the fuel gauge, ouch <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm how do I get fuel for this guy now.. hmm. Thunder creek FST 990 fuel trailer costs 29.5k and lizard pickup 1986 costs 25k, hmm guess I'll buy those for now. Gives me nice autodrive track recording vehicle at the same time too.
</p>

<p>
Purchased, budget now 52.8k. Left me with some cash to buy some actual fuel <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Took a quite while to refill thundercreek with 3.7k liters of diesel, it cost 4.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T13:15:00Z Combine refuel complete, we continue harvest.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T13:53:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field NW tip of shop.
</p>

<p>
I still have one meal left on this day, looks like 6 hours left before bed time, but I'm already seeing that yeah all the remaining fields will not be finished before night, oh well I'll go one hour at the time, we'll see where we end up.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T13:55:00Z Started harvesting soybeans field N of shop.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T14:26:00Z Lunch break, combine just have to stop when I'm away.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T14:54:00Z Feeding time over, alright last part of the day begins.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T15:16:00Z Farm bin silo got 851k liters of soybeans heh.
</p>

<p>
Yeah there is absolutely no chance of finishing this harvest season tonight, I would assume it takes few hours more on the next farming session whenever its going to be, I doubt I'll play tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Oct 1st in-game 1757hrs, its not really dark yet but far horizon starts to get pretty dark, not long before need to turn on tractor lights to drive a grain cart. Hmm not sure if I'll time accelerate to morning straight away to save any eye sight hassle, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Its funny that when we started today it was in-game 0700hrs something in that hour heh, now its evening already <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T17:00:00Z Now our farm bin silo got 1.013m liters of soybeans, whoah. Hmm wonder whats our total capacity, cant remember was it 1.250m or something like that, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Oct 1st in-game 1829hrs its now so dark had to turn on grain cart tractor lights, cant see where I'm going otherwise. This field is almost finished, then I'll shut machines down and time accelerate until tomorrow morning.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T17:38:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field N of shop.
</p>

<p>
Time accelerated until morning daylight, oct 2nd in-game 0746hrs, gooood moooorning undefiiined faaaaarms! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm now would be great time to call it a night for me, especially as the next field is biggest 4 field group we have here, hmm but honestly, dunno what would I do rest of the night hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
No... I'm going to call it a night here, lets not start get greedy and burn ourselves completely out, gives me plenty of time doing some computer chores before bed time, maybe even watch some tv or something to chill.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow hmm I really feel like tomorrow is ArmA 3 playing day and I'm afraid it might escalate into several days if not longer, but heh cant be worrying about that now.
</p>

<p>
Thundercreek FST 990 trailer was right next to lexion 8900 so decided to refuel it before saving game.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-22T17:43:00Z Saved game and shutdown fs22, dunno when I'll return to this savegame, but up until then, nites...
