	<h2>PMC Ohio Alger 10km</h2>

<p>
Terrain size: 10,240 meters x 10,240 meters, which is 10.2 kilometers x 10.2 kilometers (elmcreek is 2km). Terrain type: American, real world data. This terrain features <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xr_renegade" target="_blank">xr-renegade (twitch)</a> streamer's home farm, as it is in real life Alger, OH, USA.
</p>

PMC Ohio Alger 8km real life location in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6715957,-83.8524501,10775m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">google/maps</a>.

</div>

<p>
Heightmap is done using Ohio state website downloaded 3DEP DEM tiles, these are incredibly detailed, oddly enough I cant find link to the actual resolution specifications, one location mentions 0.3 meter which is 30 CENTIMETERS (1 foot) resolution. This is obvious when you walk around in this terrain as road elevations and road ditches can be seen and they require no manual editing like we used to do back in FS19 early days.
</p>

<p>
Satellite imagery source to create PDA mapview is <a href="https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">US National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)</a>. Resolution is 1 meter / pixel.

	<h2>New Farmer Game-Mode</h2>

<p>
New Farmer game-mode starter includes PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
<b>Vehicles:</b> PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
<b>Implements:</b> PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
<b>Product:</b> PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
<b>Land:</b> you own PMCTODO

	<h2>Fields</h2>

<p>
Fields smallest: PMCTODO ha (field ), largest PMCTODO ha (field ).
</p>

<div class="farmfields">
<pre>
PMCTODO
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That list was field definition size in hectares, the actual 3D in-game fields are much larger because cultivator_density has been painted to a accurate real world data shape where field definition (the part AI uses for contracts) only covers a simple shape area.
</p>

	<h2>Placeable Objects</h2>

<p>
When you start a savegame and not own any land with placeables, nothing shows up in ESC mapview or minimap, once you buy the land with placeables, objects like buildings appear in mapview and then you get to use them, including selling them all if you do not like their placement. No more hardcoded farm yards! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_cool.gif" alt="Smiley :cool:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Placeable objects appear in farm yards. These building objects are for example vehicle sheds, grain bin silos, fertilizer tanks (liquid/solid), diesel fuel tank, water tank etc.
</p>

<p>
Land purchase areas are detailed so that you can buy small and cheap farm yards areas. No need to save money for big huge millions costing land area if you only want to get the cool farm yard with buildings on it.
</p>

	<h2>Game-play</h2>

<p>
Selling points: total of PMCTODO selling points are distributed around the terrain. Selling points accept all grains and production chain products. Special animal dealer bale selling point is located by PMCTODO
</p>

<p>
Contracts: AI does planting on all field numbers, contracts are available.
</p>

<p>
Farm Manager and Start From Scratch game-modes include the AI owned farm yards with buildings, once you buy the land you own the buildings with ability to sell them all, same as in New Farmer game-mode where player owns one farm yard by default.
</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Twitch streamer xr-renegade is farming Alger, OH area, on january 26th 2023 xr-renegade did a twitch stream presentation about his farm, all the fields and everything included, even some other background, was great seeing that. Then we got to talk about creating real world data Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) terrain for this area.
</p>

<p>
Time went by and in march 3rd 2023 we really started to chat about creating this terrain. Rest is editing history which you can read from <a href="dev-diary-pmc-ohio-alger-10km.php">Developer Diary PMC Ohio Alger 10km</a>. Also check latest development from PMC forum topic <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=78&t=22862" target="_blank">PMC Ohio Alger 10km Development</a>.
</p>

<p>
PMC Ohio Alger 10km is the first PMC terrain which uses higher detailed heightmap than US NED 10m resolution.
</p>

<p>
We decided to publicly announce this terrain on 2023-03-10 xr-renegade's twitch live stream. This web page and official PMC forum topic went live after the twitch live stream announcement.
