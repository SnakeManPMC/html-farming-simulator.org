	<h2>September 2022</h2>

<p>
2022-09-18T20:59:00Z New farming day has started after a long break. This savegame now has 3hrs 48min on it.
</p>

<p>
I'm using the new highly experimental PMC Super Six 6km v0.2 which was just done as the name says, experiment.
</p>

<p>
And Crash To Desktop (CTD) while loading savegame <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<pre>
2022-09-18 21:01 Error: AI block info layer has invalid size.
</pre>

<p>
Going to take a restroom break and do a quick edit in Giants Editor (GE) v9.0.2, generating those collision things.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T21:14:00Z Go the fix done, generated collision maps, however I got to think that maybe that was not even the issue because I loaded old 4096 pixel resolution heightmap savegame with a new terrain version which is using 2048 pixel resolution heightmap hmm hmm. So I now generated new savegame dir and going to copy over the heightmap etc files from there into the old savegame dir.
</p>

<p>
Confusing? <i>Good</i>.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T21:19:00Z FS22 restarted after the heightmap PNG copying, now everything is working, my old Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km v0.1 savegame loaded fine with the experimental v0.2.1 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
And FPS is rock solid 60FPS, I love it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yes! heh
</p>

<p>
Quick recap just for my sake. Its 1 day seasons, currently nov in-game 1247hrs, budget is 104.6k. Unfortunately there are no good contracts, just one single sugarbeet harvesting contract which is way too much for my taste right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
So I'm going to time accelerate 6000 speed one day at the time and seeing if new contracts will come up.
</p>

<p>
Dec in-game 1004hrs, cultivating contract appeared but its 19.9ha so way too large. Jan in-game 0840hrs, no changes in contracts.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm getting a gut feeling that PMC Super Six 6km v0.2.1 would need some more field definitions for that enjoyable Start From Zero game-mode, but lets not jump into conclusions and just time accelerate some more...
</p>

<p>
Feb in-game 0824hrs, cultivating contract disappeared but nothing else shows up yet. Mar in-game 0806hrs okay now we have bunch of contracts, fertilizing F01 for crazy 154.1k and sowing contracts... except the fertilizing contract disappeared before I managed to take it, huh what?
</p>

<p>
I used better contracts mod X refresh contracts and now new ones popped up, more fertilizing ones.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T21:34:00Z Accepted fertilizing contract F03, with borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Then accepted fertilizing contract F04 and 01.
</p>

<p>
Refilled last remaining 1k liter solid fertilizer pallet to bredal k165, then purchased 8 * big bag solid fertilizer for 14.5k, times two as first went all straight to bredal k165 tank.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T21:44:00Z Started fertilizing F04, contract, manually no GPS no courseplay.
</p>

<p>
I would love to chat aka typing text here, but I cant as have to steer that tractor, no GPS is brutal <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T22:12:00Z Finished fertilizing F04, contract, collected contract reward 55.1k.
</p>

<p>
Oh nice reward. Then drove to the dealership while recording autodrive path. By the dealership topped up bredal k165 again, had to purchase 8 * big bag of solid fertilizer for 14.5k again.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T22:24:00Z Started fertilizing F01, contract, manually no GPS no courseplay.
</p>

<p>
This is a fairly large field, long passes, now I have a bit more time to type some text for this Start From Zero story but still have to be careful with tractor steering hehe.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-18T2235.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-18T2235.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
On one of these long passes I had to take a restroom break, was considering should I stop the tractor at the end of the field and just lose that time, or should I risk it and let tractor drive "hands free" all by himself while I'm relieving myself hehe.
</p>

<p>
Took the risk and it paid off, everything went OK, tractor was still driving quite a bit when I returned from the head.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T22:47:00Z But yeah, it is painful to drive without GPS or courseplay because I'm afraid to ALT-TAB to write these story texts which I enjoy doing. I have so much to say but no time to say it hehe. Cannot wait to buy our own vehicle so I can start to use those tools and then this story takes whole new turn with intensity.
</p>

<p>
My office.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-18T2257.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-18T2257.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-18T23:39:00Z Finished fertilizing F01, contract, collected contract reward 154.1k.
</p>

<p>
Whoah that contract reward <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership which was right next to F01 anyways, refilled all the remaining big bags to bredal k165. Then had to take a restroom break, been drinking water like a dog hehe.
</p>

<p>
Purchased another 8 * big bags of solid fertilizer for 14.5k, continued refilling bredal until it was topped up.
</p>

<p>
Next is F03 and she is a big one. This will be interesting because field shape is diagonal so normal 0/180/90/270 heading driving from minimap is not working, this is hardcore manual driving every moment of every pass, uuh.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-18T23:48:00Z Started fertilizing F03, contract, manually no GPS no courseplay.
</p>

<p>
Wow this field is massive heh, goodness gracious it takes a long time to fertilize this one, all done manually, geez <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T00:36:00Z Lunch break, parked tractor on the field, will continue after eating is done...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T01:04:00Z Feeding time is over, back to fertilizing this big field.
</p>

<p>
Oh man this field is huge. When this contract is done I am SO going to buy a tractor + fertilizer spreader, ANY will do, just so I can start to use GPS, courseplay and autodrive <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit: of course you have to buy LAND + vehicle in order to be allowed using automation tools (autodrive, courseplay and GPS).</i>
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T01:29:00Z Got notification that contract is 50% complete, uuh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T01:48:00Z This is numbing effect to drive tractor this accurately for this long, I need to take a quick shower break to refreshen myself a bit.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T02:06:00Z Back, we continue.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T02:15:00Z Bredal K165 is out of fertilizer (255 liters left at end of the pass), okay back to the dealership for a top up.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 * big bag of solid fertilizer for 14.5k times two.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T02:20:00Z Back on the field, next pass. Lets get this thing done.
</p>

<p>
Its really mind numbing to drive this tractor manually and constantly scan the already fertilized edge, tractor and the actual fertilizer product which is thrown from the spreader.
</p>

<p>
For example just writing the above paragraph and tractor already veered off course.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the mind numbing part comes from the field size, one pass is dunno what, over 5 min straight driving hehe.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to love and appreciate GPS/courseplay SO much after this contract! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Not much left ...
</p>

<a href="screenshots/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-19T0252.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/Start-From-Zero-PMC-Super-Six-6km-2022-09-19T0252.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="Start From Zero PMC Super Six 6km Farming Simulator 22 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2022-09-19T03:04:00Z Finished fertilizing F03, whohoo! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership and unloaded 8.9k liters of solid fertilizer from bredal k165.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T03:05:00Z Collected contract F03 reward 281.2k and returned borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 503.4k oh my <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
F01 was a big and long field, it really felt not exhausting but just mind numbing like almost starting to <i>"see things"</i> on the field that arent there when your eyes constantly scan between tractor, fertilizer edge and the spread fertilizer contact point, started to be very uncomfortable. Really glad its over now.
</p>

<p>
Actually I didn't even give any thought about how long of a contract that was, all I saw was dollar signs in my eyes when seeing such over 200k paying contract. Should have considered how nasty and long it will be.
</p>

<p>
Oh well its now done and following contracts will be done with own vehicle using GPS or maybe even courseplay, cant wait! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate, monitor contracts as always but also dealership sales, maybe I could find a cheap tractor and fertilizer spreader.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0722hrs herbicide spraying contract appeared with rubicon 9000 as borrow vehicle, but somehow I just don't feel like taking it, I am SO done with manual driving now heh. This contract was 72k reward.
</p>

<p>
May in-game 0619hrs dealership sale for kinze 4905 blue drive -43% off, but its not exactly the equipment I'm looking for. Jun in-game 0552hrs mack superliner 6x4 is on sale for -43% off. Jul in-game 0701hrs claas lexion 8900 -47% off. Sep in-game 0803hrs case ih speed-tiller 475 -64% off, nice.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 1145hrs case ih steiger quadtrac afs connect series -45% off, pretty nice deals but I'm still looking for something smaller. Hilarious contract, harvest sunflowers from F05, estimated duration 7hrs 24min and reward is juicy 428k heh. Maybe some other time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Nov in-game 1004hrs versatile 4wd -59% off, quite heavy deals we got here, almost if the game checks field sizes and takes that into consideration hehe. Feb in-game 0837hrs landini serie 7 robo-mix -43% off, pretty OK but not exactly the small tractor I'd buy.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I'm actually going to call it a night here, seems like this will take a while and I still have couple of computer chores to do before bed time so better get started. I did not plan for this earlier today, but now that PMC Super Six 6km performance bug is fixed and I'm getting enjoyable rock solid 60FPS, I'd be amazed if I didn't continue this Start From Zero bright and early tomorrow...
</p>

<p>
2022-09-19T03:38:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, good night.
