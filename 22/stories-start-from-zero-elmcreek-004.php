	<h2>September 2022</h2>

<p>
2022-09-15T19:22:00Z Searched for start from zero elmcreek savegame from earlier in 2022 but it was nowhere to be found...
</p>

<p>
Went back to PMC DevSurf to search this story page and there I see that one savegame backup copy was done in 2022-04-22, then the next day I continued playing... and apparently in that day I chose to delete the savegame without writing it down to this story page.
</p>

<p>
So I restored the 7-zip savegame backup which filename is FS22.Start.From.Zero.Elmcreek.savegame.2022-04-22T1508.7z
</p>

<p>
Edited savegame farms.xml and updated money on it to the 276.4k what I had on the next day when last entry to this story was written before this.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-15T19:48:00Z Accepted contract fertilizing F70 with borrowed vehicles. Vehicles were massey ferguson 8s.245 and bredal k165. From previous gaming session I had several solid fertilizer pallets by the dealership so I filled them to this spreader.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-15T19:53:00Z Started fertilizing F70 contract.
</p>

<p>
After finishing headland... I didn't feel like it was stupid, I just didn't feel... anything <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm I had zero interest of really putting effort into start from zero elmcreek, to start a farm etc.
</p>

<p>
Somehow I feel like the IDEA in your head about playing small scale fs22 farming was cool, but once you got the win10 SSD plugged in and fs22 playing, the actual game-play, the farming, was crap, just completely uninteresting had no passion or motivation for it.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-15T20:08:00Z Finished fertilizing F70 contract.
</p>

<p>
Drove vehicles back to the dealership and unloaded solid fertilizer, its mine.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-15T20:12:00Z Collected contract reward for F70, 15.1k - 1.6k lease == 13.5k, budget now 289.6k.
</p>

<p>
And yeah as written above I have zero feelings one way or the other to this farming session right now. I guess if I take the glass is half empty attitude then yeah <i>"this sux, thiz is boring."</i> heh. I simply have no desire to dig deep into FS22 right now especially as its this kind of useless game-play in elmcreek where I already finished a savegame (<a href="stories-new-farmer-elmcreek.php">New Farmer Elmcreek</a>).
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, continuing <a href="pmc-undefined-farms-20km.php">PMC Undefined Farms 20km</a> Start From Zero is so massive undertaking with field work taking days instead of hours, yeah I am definitely not going to do that.
</p>

<p>
2022-09-15T20:17:00Z Saved game and shutdown FS22, I'm not going to continue now, today, not like this.
