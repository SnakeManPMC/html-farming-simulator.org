	<h2>Production Chains</h2>

<p>
Production chains are good old factories, where you produce your own goods. There is a long history in FS17 and FS19 for generating fertilizer, seeds, etc along with more complex goods which can then be further used in other factories. This has always been possible through mods, until now in FS22 when we have first in-game feature for factory production chains.

<b>PMCTODO</b> Unfortunately this subject is very difficult to document just by looking at twitch live streams so more indepth writing happens as mentioned above when game activates for us.
