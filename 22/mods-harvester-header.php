Notes: 2023-08-28T16:16:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. As description states (other than the nonsense company advertisements), there are several headers from small to very large. They are all otherwise the same, same the dealership options which are cosmetic and provide no functionality while harvesting. Very good quality overall, too good I'm afraid, as if you have all the fancy pixel porno options like cranary air flow system and canola knifes and whatnot, having 4 of these headers side by side might be heavy on the GPU, dunno haven't tested but I would not be surprised, there are so many polygons on the screen as these are so detailed. Don't get me wrong, I love details like the next guy, but because none of these details provide any functionality they are purely cosmetic, it kind of feels like... "for what?" heh. Anyways, high quality great looking american wide grain headers.

<p>
Notes: 2023-09-09T08:24:00Z Tested no errors, no issues. Tested with giants john deere X9 1100 combine harvester. A lot of cosmetic options in the dealership to add more polygons into the model. The biggest header is recognized in-game as 13.7m according to modDesc.xml, however guidanceSteering recognizes it as 14.2m.
