	<h2>2022-05-23 Soybeans Harvest Season</h2>

<p>
2022-05-23T02:19:00Z New farming day has started, this savegame now has 121hrs 12min on it.
</p>

<p>
Well what can I say, woke up today and life just felt incomplete if I don't come and finish this harvest season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T02:21:00Z Started harvesting N-NE of some sorts field, big 4 field group.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T02:42:00Z First soybeans load of the day dumped to farm bin silo, its now got 1.095m liters in it.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T02:56:00Z Lunch break, I'm starvin'...
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T03:22:00Z Feeding time is over, harvest continues.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at the size of the fields remaining... it could well be that these take most of the day today, I'm trying to focus on grain cart driving now so we have minimum of combine downtime, that will increase overall harvest speed a lot. But yeah there is so many hectares of soybeans to cut that it definitely will take several hours, it would be hilarious if it took most of the day heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T04:10:00Z Another semi-truck grain load of soybeans into the farm bin silo, 1.217m there currently, next load either gets it full most likely, guess I could just scan this Start From Zero story page for details but anyways.
</p>

<p>
Current budget 45.4k so if I need to buy more bin silo extensions then need to sell soybeans straight outta combine, not ideal but what is the alternative as we have nowhere to put them.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T04:40:00Z Got my answer after that load, bin silo balance now 1.258m liters, so next stop would be 1.500m liters mark and we reach that in not time.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T06:25:00Z Another semi-truck grain trailer load heading towards farm bin silo which now has 1.461m liters of soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Moment of truth, I'm guessing that with this load we reach 1.5 million which is the capacity of current silo extensions setup. WHEN (not if) I have to sell soybeans directly from the combine, dunno where as prices are so crap right now, 1.7-1.8k so yeah guess it doesn't make any difference just pick a closest sell point to the field.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T06:31:00Z As expected silo extension capacity is 1.5m liters so now we are full, uh oh. Okay grain trailer has measily 2.4k liters which I'll sell to PMC Sell 01 and now setup truck route to nearest autodrive tracked selling point.
</p>

<p>
Plan is to sell until getting enough money to buy another silo extension.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T06:42:00Z First semi-truck grain trailer load of soybeans heading off to direct sell in PMC Sell 04, budget now 48.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T06:54:00Z Sold 40k liters of soybeans in PMC Sell 04, budget now 121.7k.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T07:00:00Z And then I was snoozing off while playing, eyes were closing, sudden case of tiredness, need to go take a nap. Saved game and shut down fs22, will continue after few hours of shut-eye...
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T10:32:00Z Back, farming continues.
</p>

<p>
I really hate to wake up from nap and setup all software and game-play conditions just the way I like them, you should always avoid naps they are no good... on the other hand, if you fall asleep at the keyboard, that's no good either.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T10:43:00Z Anyways, last pass on this four field group started, it will be over in few minutes, finally some progress.
</p>

<p>
I am feeling good harvesting now, one field is getting done and then proceeding to cut the next one, hopefully this harvest season is done today. And I might even be able to push up to the soybeans selling time, would be cool to leave this savegame as all fields harvested, vehicles refueled and metric tons of money in the bank <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T10:46:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field N-NE, some four field group. And right at the same time semi-truck grain trailer dumped 40k load of soybeans into PMC Sell 04, budget now 194.6k.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T10:47:00Z Started harvesting soybeans field N-NE from shop, 2 fields N-S aligned.
</p>

<p>
Purchased THREE unia farma 250 grain silo extensions 64k each. These hold 250k liters so we got 750k liter increase, I really hope this is enough for remaining of the harvest. With quick calculation we now have 2.250m liters capacity, please lets try to remember this for the next harvest season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh right, budget now 2.1k so with vehicle maintenance through these two last field harvests we are probably going to drop to negative value <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Poor farmers.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T11:05:00Z First semi-truck soybeans load dumped to the new silo extensions, wonder what the final liter count will be once harvest season is done. Probably too much considering I have to haul all that crap to selling points hehe.
</p>

<p>
Overloading.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T12:16:00Z And now its time to cook food and eat... combine for sure gets full and just sits on the field before I return, but man's gotta eat.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T12:41:00Z Hah claas lexion 8900 is out of diesel fuel <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T13:02:00Z Feeding time over, back to cutting soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Refueled all vehicles, combine, grain cart tractor and semi-truck. We are good to go for the finish of this harvest season. And had to check, yes fuel usage level is LOW heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T13:17:00Z Finished harvesting soybeans field N-NE from shop, 2 fields N-S aligned.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T13:17:00Z Started harvesting field E of shop.
</p>

<p>
Great mood now that harvesting the last field, now I'm so excited I'm already planning on playing ArmA 3 tonight, so I'm convinced this harvest gets finished and can even sell the crops on that highest selling day before saving game for a long archive storage <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'm actually planning on selling all the lands, to transfer my farm into vehicles + money only. Not sure if I sell placeables as they are good but land most likely will be edited from the terrain side before I continue playing this savegame next time.
</p>

<p>
It will definitely be a long break for this savegame, as said I want to play ArmA 3 and I NEED to release PMC Grande Gardens 16km and PMC Iowa Garden City 8km before doing any other farmsim work.
</p>

<p>
But for now, we keep harvesting <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T14:25:00Z Must say, driving that kinze 1051 to grain trailer is getting a bit old because it cannot do a full grain trailer with its 37k liter capacity. Sure I could configure autodrive to go with less percentage than 100% so semi-truck would depart to farm bin silo after each time I overload to it, but dunno I rather keep it full loads only.
</p>

<p>
Well all that will be fixed on next harvest season when we have a bigger tractor and a grain cart. I am really wanting to try out the mother bin as well, even though its not really used in american farming.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T14:37:00Z Farm bin silo currently holds 1.906m liters, wonder if there is enough room for rest of this fields grain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T15:18:00Z Courseplay combine turned lights on, oct 2nd in-game 1713hrs.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T15:30:00Z Couple of times have been ALT-TABbed to research ArmA 3 stuff and then combine got full as I got lost in my thoughts when having interesting reading, ouch need to pay attention, combine must never stop <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now we got 2.028m liters of soybeans in the bin, heh.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T15:39:00Z At in-game 1735hrs suddenly there was a huge drop in daylight. Wow, good job fs22! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
That must have been some seasons climate changing, as its now oct 2nd so last day of october in two day seasons. But heck man, no transition on the lighting at all, I wouldn't mind if it gradually changed in 60 seconds period or something but it was instant switch heh, looks like crap, you're thinking who turned the lights off <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T16:02:00Z Oct 2nd in-game 1758hrs, it started to rain and thunder heh, courseplay did not stop the combine and we are on the last pass so I'll keep going until the end! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well I celebrated too soon, at top of the hour oct 2nd in-game 1800hrs sharp courseplay stopped, cannot harvest when crops are wet <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Was so close of finishing this harvest season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Saved game, just in case. Then time accelerated until rain ended at 2149hrs. And combine is rolling last few meters of this pass which will finish the whole harvest season <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T16:11:00Z Finished harvesting field E of shop. That is it, harvest season is a wrap! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then just parked combine and grain cart tractor in the field, because I want all vehicles to be in fields once I do terrain upgrade. Then overloaded grain cart contents into semi-truck grain trailer and drove the truck to farm bin silo and unloaded trailer. Drove versatile 4wd 620 with bourgault air drill and pickup truck with fuel trailer into a field as well.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T16:18:00Z Farm bin silo now has 2.123m liters of soybeans! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided after all that no I'm not going to do that grain hauling, I feel so exhausted of farming right now and all I can do is think about playing ArmA 3 so I'm going to leave grain hauling until returning to fs22 playing and this savegame, then I have plenty of motivation to drive some grain trailer, also gives some exciting stuff to do while selling over 2 million liters of soybeans.
</p>

<p>
2022-05-23T16:19:00Z Saved game and exited fs22, until the next time.
