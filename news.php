<p>
2024-10-26T07:12:09Z Created empty placeholder pages for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) modifications aka mods pages, all the same sub categories as FS22 has. This is because I will be extremely busy on FS25 release day, I have no time and even less interest of editing HTML web pages, so its best to do it now that I have nothing but free time while waiting for FS25 release date to arrive. Yeah I kind of hate to keep empty pages up, some people might think its some sort of clickbait and yes technically I could comment out those pages so visitors could not get to the pages unless they know the direct https link to it, but that still leaves me one more HTML editing task once FS25 releases and I'll generate new content, so nope, placeholder pages are up with good disclaimer why they are there. But for example this news item, no need to link to mods page as there is nothing to see, I sort of just wanted to post news for the history books as this was kind of big ordeal to get all those mod- pages done, my copy-paste fingers are aching, bad <img src="images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-10-25T07:36:57Z Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) modifications aka Mods index page got updated, tons of new pages created for different categories, check them out at <a href="22/mods.php">FS22 Mods</a>. Edit: another update at 2024-10-25T12:57:10Z

</p>

<p>
2024-10-23T03:21:47Z Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) information added, todays news come already from oct 21st but I've been a bit busy HTML web page editing so this low priority news had to wait a bit. Giants released information about FS25 AI Characters. See a new <a href="25/news-pre-release/ai-characters.php">AI Characters</a> web page what they are all about.
</p>

<p>
2024-10-22T02:07:19Z New <a href="17/mods-pending-testing.php">Farming Simulator 17 (FS17) Mods Pending Testing</a> page created. Unfortunately I don't even have FS17 installed anymore and FS25 being three or so weeks away it would be highly unlikely for me to return testing some FS17 mods in fall of 2024. However this pending testing page does serve purpose that those mods that have not been tested by me will be clearly marked so in that category page.

<p>
2024-10-20T16:19:42Z Forgot to mention, huge amounts of work has been done in the past day for various web pages, I posted about them in <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22942" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum "PMC Farming website farming-simulator.org" topic</a>.

	<h2>News 2019</h2>

<p>
2019-06-17 the re-design / re-make project was completed. I went through all the terrains in reversed alphabetical order and re-made then from scratch. Today all of them have the above mentioned features plus Texas Rowena even has all the buildings and utility poles placed as well.
</p>

<p>
2019-05-05 there was an issue with terrain scale being off, I started a huge project of re-design / re-make of all our terrains from ground up, I used no existing files, it was a total re-make.
</p>

<p>
2019-02-02 FS19 terrain development studies begun, I had earlier experience from 2018 doing FS17 terrains so it was not a fresh start.
