	<h2>AI Characters FS25</h2>

<p>
2024-10-21 Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) pre-release news time. Giants released talking <b>FS25 AI Character</b> information today. Text in italics is direct copy-paste from giants website blog, normal text is my writing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Talking to the townsfolk...</i> -source <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/newsArticle.php?news_id=566" target="_blank">Giants website blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
People in Giants Forum seem to be quite upset about how badly FS25 is turning out to be as more pre-release news information is slowly released, I'm quite surprised because people are so vocal if not bold about it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Farming Simulator 25 features a small ensemble of characters to talk to - NPCs. If you decide to talk to them. Let's learn more about them and how they work.</i>
</p>

<p>
Err NPC, what the hell is en-pee-see, haha! They are called Artificial Intelligence (AI), use proper terminology.
</p>


	<h2>Adding Characters & Guidance</h2>

<p>
<i>We wanted to make the towns a bit more lively, so you can meet a handful of virtual people, brought to life by real voice actors. Each character has their own personality and area of expertise. Because we were able to create the characters without drawing developer resources from other game features, we added them as a side bonus.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>To provide especially new virtual farmers some touching points in the form of guidance, they offer some advice and help for the farming basics. If you want to know more about them, you can just casually talk to them and see what spontaneously comes to their mind. Sometimes they might ask what you think.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>They may also need a helping hand and offer you some contract when there's something to be done in the neighborhood.</i>
</p>


	<h2>Grandpa Walter</h2>

<p>
<i>As is traditional in farming, the farm is passed down from generation to generation. In this case, however, Grandpa Walter isn't passing the farm on to his son, who would normally be next in line, but wanted to explore another life away from the countryside.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Walter will share some of his experience and tell you more about the history of the family farm, and send you to his trusted, old friend and helper if you require assistance for modern agriculture.</i>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>I’m doin’ this for a while now. Despite all the modernization, there are still farmers sitting on tractors, right? My own grandfather, yes I had one too, he was old-school. And I mean it in the actual definition.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He did everything on horseback. Plowing, sowing, getting to town and delivering his produce to the market. As did most of the others. Horses were the backbone of it all.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Back then, a significant portion of his farm was about horse breeding and selling strong, healthy mares and stallions to other farmers.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Then, tractors became a thing. Slowly, at first. Then, more and more horses were retired from plowing duty.</i>
</p>


	<h2>Helper Ben</h2>

<p>
<i>Having been the trusted friend of Walter's for more than 30 years, Ben can tell beginners more about the farming basics. How to sow and harvest crops, operate the machines for the various field working steps, and more. He's always near at the starting farm.</i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/AI-Character-Helper-Ben-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/AI-Character-Helper-Ben-01.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="AI Character Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="AI Character Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
<i>Well, since your grandfather slowed down, he didn't really bother with the latest machines and did a lot of stuff... well, in an "old school" kind of way.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>That's probably why he sent you to me.  I'm an avid reader of all those agricultural magazines, you know. Old, but still learning...</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>If you come to me, I can help you make sure everything grows well in the fields.</i>
</p>


	<h2>Neighbor David</h2>

<p>
<i>Neighbor David is not a farmer, but tries to be. He's a beginner. He made some mistakes on the way and will warn others not to repeat them. In return, you may tell him, that it would be better for him to learn operating a baler instead of opening a hotel with wellness treatments, offering people to sleep on fresh hay - which he heard from others is a thing.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Additionally, being from the city, he can explain his perspective on both city life and living in the country and how he learned to really appreciate farming when he put his hands into the soil himself.</i>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Looks like there is some discussion dialog selector at bottom of the screen, not to be overly negative but I'm expecting there to be 10 or so options you can chat with these AI Character guys/gals and once you have done those in 5min or so, then these AI character interactions have absolutely ZERO use in the rest of FS25 game-play history. I saw this same thing happen in ArmA 2 when bis introduced the interactive AI spoken dialog, it was a cheap short lived gimmick which I never used in my missions/campaigns.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sure, there are reasons for that. Growing practices so we can feed the population with huge amounts of food, for example.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I then learned that produce for mass markets is often harvested before it is fully ripe to withstand transportation and storage, for example.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Refrigeration, humidity control, long periods of storage, and so on. That all of these can affect the flavor and what you can taste and smell.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Never thought about that when I was still your common city boy. But I know now. And I appreciate what I harvest with my own hands even more now.</i>
</p>


	<h2>Animal Farmer Katie</h2>

<p>
<i>After traveling the world, Katie came home and took over the animal farm from her family. She is a hands-on person and can explain the basics of livestock farming. If you want to know more about her, she can share some personal stories and anecdotes from her travels.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Most of her anecdotes include animals in some way, and some of her stories are just myths she collected here and there. She's not always serious.</i>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>Aren’t you a curious one!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>When I was reading about medieval farming, I was reminded that I really loved our farm, and the country life surrounded by nature, animals and livestock.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>So I changed my major to agricultural sciences and only minored in history. Can’t escape your families' legacy sometimes, huh?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>When I finished college, I traveled the world and worked on farms to see how they were doing things in other countries and cultures.</i>
</p>


	<h2>Lumberjack Noah</h2>

<p>
<i>Noah is the local forester and lumberjack. His main profession is taking care of the forest, making sure it's handled with respect. If needed, he can explain the forestry basics.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>But he prefers to talk more about woodcarving, even though his well-crafted objects are usually not as practical as he thinks, and you are free to point out flaws in his designs.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Since he also likes detective stories, he will pursue anyone who leaves an empty can of Fizzy Sprizz lemonade in the forest. Prepare to get a preventative lesson on how to behave in the woods.</i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="screenshots/AI-Character-Lumberjack-Noah-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/AI-Character-Lumberjack-Noah-01.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="AI Character Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="AI Character Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>
</p>

<p>
<i>This is what some people think of me and my profession, and it fills me with emotions on the negative side. It is important to handle any forest with care and respect to leave its overall structure intact.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I just wanted to make sure that you know that my job is not to eliminate all the trees around here.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>We take what we need, we replace it, and we are respectful of the forest and its inhabitants. It also helps David so he can meditate in one of its clearings.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He already got a lesson on littering in the woods. I am a bit skeptical, but I believe him when he says that it fell out of his pocket. He stays under surveillance nonetheless.</i>
</p>
