<p>
Please note that terrain deformation is just tyre tracks, same thing that we've had in FS19 already (I think FS17 as well), this time they just cause terrain heightmap to temporarily dig a small dip for the tyre. So don't get too excited about this feature, to me this is more like a quick hasty gimmick than anything worth paying money for in a new game engine.

"Weather Change: Twisters & Hail With a Chance of Fog. the weather is predicted to change more often. Once the storm passes, local farmers are advised to inspect their fields for any destruction and assess the impact on their crops. [farmer] lost about half of his crops on a rather tiny plot and all of his bales left out in the open. lumberjack and forester of Riverbend Springs was not available for comment while tending to dead trees that were affected by the storm." -source <a href="https://www.farming-simulator.com/newsArticle.php?news_id=552" target="_blank">Giants website blog</a>.

Hail possibly could damage crops, see image Hail-Storm-02.jpg for details. Also bales can be apparently damaged.

Environmental fog CANNOT be turned OFF :( -source djgoham <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a54sHgyxaZM" target="_blank">FS25 - EXCLUSIVE NEW VIDEOS (Breakdown & Analysis) | Farming Simulator 25 Live</a>.

Environment has that idiotic floating garbage same as FS17, the horror is back after all these years, no idea what the hell the floaters are supposed to be, they are not leafs, or insects, just no idea, but it looks like crap, very annoying, feels like going back in time to 2016 in FS17 era :(

Tornado official giants term is "twister", in english language tornados other name is twister, however in common american english tornados are called... well tornados. Tornadoes happen AT MOST once a year but its not guaranteed every year, they usually appear in the warmer months (not at winter time). Tornadoes destroy crops, bales and trees, but not buildings or vehicles. Tornadoes will NOT lift objects off the ground like players or vehicles. Tornadoes or "inclement weather" can be turned OFF in game settings. Hale destroys crops and bales. You CANNOT turn off FOG. Animals are just the same as in FS22, only new stuff is water buffalo and goat 3D models. Tornado destroyed trees you can cut with a chainsaw but not with a regular logging vehicle. Tornado picks up debris, this is purely a visual effect. European terrain is FS22 Zielonka. Production chains stage coach construction, the coach appears, then over time it disappears (huh?). -source youtube djgoham <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IINgPq4980g" target="_blank">"FS25 Q&A with GIANTS Software! | The Farm Sim Show Podcast"</a>.
