New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

	<h2>2024-11-15 Grass Baling For Silage</h2>

<p>
2024-11-15T19:07:24Z New farming day has started, did the mandatory computer morning chores, no Giants Editor (GE) v10 release yet, checked FS25 mods, real life clock mod came out that's nice, added that in and now launched the game itself.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 51hrs 31min on it.
</p>

<p>
But first I need to re-configure real clock mod config XML file. Got the edit done:
</p>

<pre>
format string="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
</pre>

<p>
2024-11-15T19:33:22Z Now that day has started, FS25 is up and new mod is configured, its time for me to eat days first meal...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T19:59:07Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday was thinking about how to grow my farm quicker or well more efficiently, so ended up planning on starting silage baling operation. Hmm maybe to take a bank loan, lease plow and big tractor, then plow F03-05 together, then purchase mower, baler and bale wrapper assuming FS25 doesn't have a baler with built in wrapper. Then of course anderson rbm2000 bale collector trailer. That would get me started with silage baling operation. Bales could be stored outside anywhere while waiting for best market price day to arrive.
</p>

<p>
Already drove challenger mt665 with bredal k105 to F05 ready to start fertilizing when I realized, oh okay I had other plans heh, so yeah that bank loan, lease of plow, merge those fields together, return the plow and tractor, then buy silage equipment. But first, going to document all silage baling equipment prices and capabilities.
</p>

<p>
While starting to do that silage equipment list I realized first problem in my plan, kverneland optima rs does NOT plant grass, so I need to buy a seeder of some sorts.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T21:07:45Z Finished typing all that stuff in, mowers, balers, bale trailers and wrappers. Almost started to feel frustrated of spending that time documenting instead of actually playing and making money, but now that the v1.2.1 base game equipment is documented it lasts for FS25 lifetime (assuming giants wont edit/remove or add anything).
</p>

<p>
Leased vaderstad nz extreme 1425 plow, base costs: 2.5k, per work day: 1.2k, per work hour: 2.6k.
</p>

<p>
Leased fendt 1050 with twin wheels, base costs: 8.6k, per work day: 4.3k, per work hour: 9k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T21:20:54Z Started plowing F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T21:41:14Z Finished plowing F02.
</p>

<p>
During running digger to this field I realized that it should have been fertilized first, oh well. Next task is a big one, or well not big but important one, merge plowing together F03, F04 and F05. Removing the roads and perhaps slightly increase the size on the E end. I'm not really interested of cutting down trees especially with the tree stumps issue.
</p>

<p>
This also gives me a documentation problem, once these fields are merged into one big one, what do I call it, heh no idea. Guess I could just call it F05.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T21:46:09Z Started plowing F05, manually GPS. Merging F03-F05 together, creating a new field.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-15T2158.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-15T2158.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Very careful driving with fendt 1050 vario, thats exactly the reason I chose front wheel steering tractor instead of twitchy articulated one.
</p>

<p>
I sold one old shed placeable between F05 and F04 S side, that revealed some idiotic "collectible" which I had to take with R key to remove it from the area I wanted to plow into a field, that gave me 10k fantasy kiddie money, sigh. Oh well I'm not cheating, its how giants designed the game to be played, but then again they added money making placeable cheat objects like greenhouses, solar panels and wind turbines as well, so yeah anyways. It was not a show stopper to get that 10k but I still hate it. Okay plowing continues.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:09:21Z Finished plowing F05.
</p>

<p>
Now I have a cool new irregular size F05 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now I have to decide what to do next, grass needs a seeder, should I keep fendt 1050 vario and lease big seeder like amazone citane 150001-c or whatever the model number was, hmm.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:11:39Z Returned vaderstad nz extreme 1425, its done its job.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:15:04Z Started fertilizing F05, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
This is now my brand new merged field <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:22:32Z Finished fertilizing F05.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and took a restroom break before fertilizing last, err my second field.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:26:52Z Started fertilizing F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T22:30:57Z Finished fertilizing F02.
</p>

<p>
First layer of fertilization is in, I'm sort of leaning towards just seeding grass next and then fertilizing right after seeding, hmm. Saved game just to lock in progress.
</p>

<p>
Leased kinze 4905 blue drive "multifruit" planter which does grass, base costs: 4.9k, per work day: 2.4k, per work hour: 5.2k. Purchased 3 big bags of seeds for 3.7k, then refilled kinze planter with seeds.

<p>
Grass planting season (if there is one, heh) is done, now just need to put in second layer of fertilizer and its all done. Drove fendt 1050 vario with kinze 4905 blue drive planter to the farm yard, unloaded remaining seeds, then returned both leased vehicles.

<p>
2024-11-16T00:25:22Z Then got caught chatting in giants discord editing channel and watching jdunn1019 live stream just some random FS25 stuff.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T00:37:24Z And now alarm went off for a lunch break, OK time to eat celebratory junk food, hopefully all this jdunn1019 and other discord activity fades away while I'm eating, I want to get back to peace and calm of playing farmsim <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T01:31:43Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Eating got done a while ago, now just trying to get away from that chat, time accelerated to mar in-game 0928hrs and now grass is ready to harvest. Yield bonus 95% so quite good. Now need to buy mower, baler with hopefully wrapper and anderson rbm2000 bale collector, then I'm set to sell some silage bales.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T02:03:37Z Okay finally done with streams and stuff, now begins silage baling operation.
</p>

<pre>
- mower 110hp 3.4m 22km/h samasz kdf 341 s (tractor front attach) 14k
- mower 220hp 9.4m 22km/h samasz kdd 941 sth (tractor rear attach) 70.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above list, budget now 87.1k. Then drove challenger mt665 to the dealership to pickup these new mower equipment, however realized on my way there that this tractor does not have front ... hitch thing, its just got permanent weight in the front. Hmph. Okay guess the spending spree really begins now, I need to buy some tractor for mower duty now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Samasz KDD 941 STH requires 220hp so that is the minimum requirement for any tractor I buy. Hmm need to find some cheap but still nice tractor. Browsed through medium tractors category and guess I'll go with case ih puma, so first had to take that dreaded bank loan. I plan on just taking as much as I need instead of just maxing it out to whatever it gives.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T02:22:47Z Took 215k loan.
</p>

<p>
Purchased case ih puma 260 cvxdrive with narrow twin wheels 276.5k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T02:31:21Z Started mowing grass F02, manual GPS.

<p>
2024-11-16T02:42:49Z Finished mowing grass F02.
</p>

<p>
Hmm that went OK, puma 260 afs connect front wheel turn radius is atrociously low, it takes a huge ways to make this guy turn, oh well. Also this was my first ever grass mowing in FS25, there was some odd issue with front mower bouncing and leaving a missed spot, this happened several times so it was not just a random fluke, hopefully this is not on all mowing operations.

<p>
Took more bank loan to get budget for a baler.
</p>

<pre>
- baler 100hp 125-180cm 17km/h (round, wrap) kuhn vb 3190 69.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above. Picked it up from the dealership, it had "roundbale net 2/2" status, I assume this is the STRING line thing that holds grass together as a bale.

<p>
2024-11-16T04:23:34Z Few minutes ago ran out of rounbale net stuff, rolls, but got caught chatting in giants discord editing channel a bit, OK enough, now driving to the dealership to buy some rounbale net rolls.
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership, purchased one umm pack of rounbale net rolls things, was quite cheap, but I had hard time getting it to refill into the machine, I moved around and hit R and nothing, then was shuffling something and just suddenly noticed that it had reloaded it, dunno at which point. Then drove back to F05, not much left, one half of a headland I think.
</p>

<p>
Was thinking about this roundbale net roll thing, guess its realistic but I do wonder if its just another layer of unnecessary grind, hmm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T04:43:47Z Finished baling grass F05.

Then off to the dealership to take more bank loan and buy more equipment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Decided to buy that good old - bale wrapper 125-150cm round, 180-220cm square kuhn sw 4014 55k
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T04:48:04Z Took more bank loan and purchased the above.
</p>

<p>
Picked kuhn sw 4014 up, drove to the farm yard and then it was bale wrapping time.

2024-11-16T05:02:31Z Started wrapping grass bales F05.
</p>

<p>
However after doing 2 bales I realized how big field relatively speaking this is and I'm getting hungry, so decided to take a lunch break now before continuing further into this bale wrapping session.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T05:23:26Z Feeding time is over, back to wrapping grass bales.
</p>

<p>
At this point I started to feel that this two field silage bale wrapping task is taking a long time, its difficult to compare in actual numbers, but my own gut feeling tells me that this has already taken longer than regular YEARLY cycle of one soybeans planting and harvest season set. But dunno maybe I'm wrong, guess my diary style story telling with UTC timestamps sheds some light on that if I were ever to go back and compare numbers.
</p>

<p>
This simply feels like its taking a very very long time, so the money I'm getting out of these silage bales is better to be really good.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T05:45:11Z Finished wrapping grass bales F05.
</p>

<p>
This task felt like it took forever, I have zero interest of doing it again right after this, which I'm afraid is waiting for me as you can get two harvestes out of a grass field per year. Heh wow, didn't think of that. Baling and grass to silage bale wrapping is fun, relaxing, however as I said in my previous FS22 stories it stops being relaxing when you are doing it for hours and hours (no idea if it has been hours but feels like it). So indeed this is surprising, I had no idea I can get bored of FS25 baling this quickly and I bought a vehicle and all these equipment just for money making reason, to do a lot of silage bales for sell, yet here I am after the very first silage baling operation and I'm already kind of bored out of my mind of baling <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

2024-11-16T05:58:23Z Purchased anderson rbm2000 bale collecting trailer for 50.5k after taking sixty some thousand more bank loan. Current bank loan is 380k, yikes! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Another interesting discovery earlier was bale wrapping plastic color, I made the mistake of choosing the dark green slightly turqoise shade color, well I didn't think ahead, this is very close to the natural grass bale color, they are different but when you are driving a tractor with a bale wrapper and scanning the horizon for unwrapped bales... let me tell ya, its very difficult to spot those grass unwrapped bales in the field with all them dark green / turqoise wrapped soon to become silage bales. Never ever choose green shade of bale wrapping film color, always use pure white which has high contrast to nature. Oh well, lesson learned, wont be repeating this mistake ever again. In fact PMCTODO document this to playing guide.

<p>
2024-11-16T06:10:24Z First 24 silage bale load dumped into the woods, heh yep sounds bad "the woods", but it was the only safe place I could find from my farm yard, I don't want to knock over a line of round bales while driving around the farm yard.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:17:37Z Finished collecting silage bales F05.
</p>

<p>
This field got 2 * 24 silage bale loads, plus four more after that. Hmm dunno why but I was expecting more in numbers, especially as how long this silage baling operation has taken, hmm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:18:55Z Started collecting silage bales F02.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:25:08Z Finished collecting silage bales F02.
</p>

<p>
Quite underwhelming amount of silage bales out of F02, hmm I'm thinking more and more that maybe I should keep F02 as soybeans, hmm not sure. Will have to contemplate on that once this season is fully over and can figure out when I get to sell silage bales etc.
</p>

<p>
After dumping the last silage bale load into the forest, I parked anderson rbm2000 into open vehicle shed and saved game. Now a quick restroom break before fertilizing my fields once again.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:35:39Z Started fertilizing F05, manually GPS.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-16T0636.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-16T0636.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:41:43Z Finished fertilizing F05.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:42:34Z Started fertilizing F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T06:46:38Z Finished fertilizing F02.
</p>

<p>
All field work done for the next grass harvest, glad that didn't take more work, but I'm still not looking forward to starting a new grass harvest operation, hmm. Checked my timer for been awake 17hrs alarm but its unfortunately still over 4hrs away which is a life time in gaming session hours, but man I feel exhausted and tired both mixed into a nice mild blend, I just don't have mental energy to attack that second grass harvest right away now. Hopefully I could get to sell these existing bales but hmm I doubt, the harvest most likely is next seasonal event.
</p>

<p>
But if I'm calling it a night here what the heck do I do this remaining 4hrs as there is not even any good tv shows/movies to watch, hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Parked bredal k105 into a vehicle shed, walked into middle of F05 and saved game. I need to just stand here for a moment and chill thinking about what do I want to do next. Well of course I'll check the silage best market price day, that would be fun to do, sell those bales next.
</p>

<p>
Oh, while I was checking silage I realized that hey I have 33.9k liters of soybeans too, heh already forgot it, that silage baling operation felt so long and exhausting that forgot all about my soybean stock <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Silage best selling day is may and then soybeans in jun, so going to get quickly into some money with selling these existing stock items.
</p>

<p>
May in-game 0919hrs its raining and silage selling day is here, jumped into case ih puma 260 and took anderson rbm2000, then started to load silage bales into the trailer.
</p>

<p>
Drove silage bale load to farmers market, but it was regular selling point and did not accept bales. So then had to pick those bales back up again and take them to biogas plant.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T07:19:59Z Sold 24 silage bales at biogas plant for 48.6k.
</p>

<p>
Then back to the farm yard forest to pickup another 24 silage bale load.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T07:32:20Z Sold 24 silage bales at biogas plant for 48.6k.
</p>

<p>
Hmm giants neutered silage price in fs25 because it was mere month or two ago I was selling silage in F22 for over 500 price.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T07:42:14Z Sold 24 silage bales at biogas plant for 48.5k. Looks like price is slightly dropping, nothing too bad though. Now I only have one few bales load left to sell.
</p>

<p>
Picked up 12 remaining bales from the farm yard forest.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T07:50:40Z Sold 12 silage bales at biogas plant for 24.2k.
</p>

<p>
All the silage has been sold, budget now 181.7k. Drove case ih puma 260 with anderson rbm2000 bale collecting trailer back to the farm yard and parked next to the farm grain bin, saved game. Now just one more day time accelerating and then is soybeans best market price day, that would be cool ending for my fairly long farming day.
</p>

<p>
Paid off loan, now only 200k left, budget now 1.7k <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0839hrs, overnight loan interest was 666, yep that's correct, the number of the BEAST <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Loaded 33.9k liters of soybeans into grain trailer and then off to grain river silo selling point.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T08:05:28Z Sold 33.9k liters of soybeans in grain river silo for 121.9k, budget now 123.1k.
</p>

<p>
Drove tractor back to the farm yard and parked grain trailer next to a shed. Then thought quickly what to do next on my way shutting this savegame down for the night, I could leave it for tomorrow but I want to finish off today nicely, so I'm going to pay off the loan as much as possible. I have two grass fields ready to harvest which yields hmm how many loads of over 45k each so money is not a problem in that sense, I don't need to spend anything before getting grass mowed and done to silage, so yeah paying loan off as much as possible to avoid future nightly interest fees.
</p>

<p>
Paid off all the money I had, bank loan left 80k. Budget now 3.1k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T08:13:55Z Saved game and shutdown fs25, going to chill before bed time, good night.
</p>
