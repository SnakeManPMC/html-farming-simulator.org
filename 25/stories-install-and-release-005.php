	<h2>2024-11-11 Expected Release Day</h2>

<p>
2024-11-11T11:03:00Z Good morning, I'll label this header as the release day because I just woke up from 5hrs 21min sleep, unfortunately my sleeping schedule is not matching very good with FS25 release time as I hoped it would, I just cant decide how many hours I sleep, it ranges from anything from 4 to 7 on average days, today it was just five. I'm hoping to take a nap closer to the release time so I'm fully energetic at just before 2300hrs today.
</p>

<p>
So now I'm going to wrap up my Sea Power beta team work, release all those Sea Power website edits and well, then its just waiting for 2300hrs H-hour <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T14:05:00Z Editing Sea Power HTML web pages while watching FS25 twitch live stream on right side monitor, yawn came out, cool, this is good news as I'm hoping to take a long nap after my Sea Power pre early access release work is done. Man I am starting to get a little excited, its difficult to believe that today approximately 2302hrs if everything goes according to schedule, I get to see FS25 intro video <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T17:09:00Z Okay all Sea Power work has been done and I've said my thank you's in Microprose Sea Power discord, I'm feeling not overly tired but still kind of zoned out, so this is perfect time to go take as long nap as I can, unfortunately I doubt it would be longer than max 3hrs but even that is better than nothing. Then I'm ready for FS25 release moment <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<b>Zzz... Zzz...</b>
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T21:06:00Z Back or perhaps I should say "good morning" here, only managed to sleep 3hrs 49min and I'm not sure how good quality sleep that was, but it will have to do, I'm up now and today is Farming Simulator 25 release day! Next time I'll sleep is when I can literally no longer keep my eyes open and are just snoozing off in front of the computer! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Man I cant believe this day is finally here, FS25 will be released in two hours, LESS than two hours, this is so cool! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah man, dunno, maybe I should take a breath, chill a bit, not to get overly excited because if giants has outdone themselves again and FS25 sucks ass, then I am so disappointed that all this preparation, all the junk food I purchased for this two week planned farmsim marathon, all that is for nothing if the game is lame. Heh yeah well you have to hope for the best and expect the worst.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:10:00Z It is time. Going to switch over to PMC Gaming computer while eating days first meal so to speak. Its still 50min until the release which gives me plenty of time to feed. I'll get the system up, notepad++ with this story up, maybe dajnet twitch live stream running, then of course serial key in copy-paste clipboard and wait for the H-hour <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I simply cannot wait, I'm so excited man, ooh aah! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
