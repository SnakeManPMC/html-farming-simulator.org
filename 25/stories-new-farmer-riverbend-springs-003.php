New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

	<h2>2024-11-13 Harvesting Soybeans</h2>

<p>
2024-11-13T15:21:02Z New farming day has started, just woke up and did the mandatory computer morning chores, didn't check new FS25 mods though, I don't really like to do it with Gaming computer but there is so much time during todays 17hrs farming session that some of it can be spent browsing mod websites.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 21hrs 5min on it.
</p>

<p>
Going to start this farming day by doing one more contract, I think there was one baling contract available last night. But overall the plan is to time accelerate into next years soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
Aug in-game 1242hrs I could plant canola now, but its one of those things that what you can do NOW is not necessarily the most profitable, if I do canola now then next years soybeans planting season has to be skipped, well unless I buy more fields but heh with what money would I do that, indeed. Okay so contract or two, then time accelerating to the next year. Oh and my days first meal is coming up soon too.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T15:30:22Z Accepted contract baling F43, borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Generated steering assistant "GPS line" for straw baling contract, but the line didn't match the loose straw swath on the field at all. Had to re-generate it using hmm was it 8m or 9m working width, then it matched at least the outer most headland, OK time to start.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T15:36:48Z Started contract baling F43, manual driving.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T15:41:43Z Finished contract baling F43, collected reward 1.5k.
</p>

<p>
And now, its time to eat days first meal, I'm starving and its FS25 celebration junk food for hopefully two weeks, yippy! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_razz.gif" alt="Smiley :p" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:03:36Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:05:14Z Accepted contract fertilizing F24, F44 and F62.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:08:25Z Started contract fertilizing F24, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:15:25Z Finished contract fertilizing F24, collected reward 12.2k.
</p>

<p>
Decent contract reward, this is one of the largest I've seen so far, over ten grand. Now amazone spreader is out of product, only 106 liters left, time to visit the dealership.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 2 big bags of solid fertilizer for 3.8k. After refilling solid fertilizer I drove john deere 3650 tractor to the dealership repair point building other side of the lot and repaired the tractor, weight and amazone spreader, it was something like 3-3.5k cost total. Going to check if there is a gas station nearby I could use a diesel fuel, but if there isn't one along my traveling path then no big deal I'll refuel later.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:29:17Z Started contract fertilizing F62, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:30:44Z Finished contract fertilizing F62, collected reward 1.7k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:33:09Z Started contract fertilizing F44, manual driving (GPS not working).
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T16:34:20Z Finished contract fertilizing F44, collected reward 1.2k.
</p>

<p>
One pass and done! Haha!
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then it was time to check world wide web for updates, new mods etc. Not to take a break but yeah it will take a moment to go through all that's been happening, just a small breather.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:20:43Z Okay everything done, downloaded some mods, basic documented them, pre-checked them with FSG Mod Assistant, then well nothing to do, time to get back in-game, farming continues.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:22:31Z Accepted contract fertilizing F50.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:24:42Z Started contract fertilizing F50, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:27:28Z Finished contract fertilizing F50, collected reward 3.9k.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't pay much but it also doesn't take very long either, so yeah.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:29:13Z Accepted contract bale wrapping F45, borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:32:17Z Started contract bale wrapping F45, manual driving.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T17:37:55Z Finished contract bale wrapping F45, collected reward 4.6k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 204.3k whoah broke the magical 200k limit mark <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
All the good contracts have been done now, okay next up is time accelerating towards next years soybeans planting season, will be monitoring the dealership sales and contracts board daily.
</p>

<p>
Dec in-game 0922hrs its now oats best selling day, well at the last moment finances screen changed it to jan but oddly the price is still less than its now so I'm going to start hauling grain for sell.
</p>

<p>
Oh crap, the best grain selling point was other side of the (little girlie men 2km) terrain! Oh no! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Checked second best selling point and it was equally far, just N instead of S, sigh. Okay what the hell, lets haul to the other side of the terrain with this 8k liter trailer then. What can you do, right <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T1754.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T1754.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Stopped by the dealership, diesel refueled challenger mt635, then repaired it and farmtech edk 650 trailer, also checked if I could customize the trailer but no, its capacity is already at max, okay continuing grain hauling.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T18:05:26Z First 8k load of oats sold at grain barge terminal 1 for about 14k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T18:16:33Z Sold second load of oats for 14.9k.
</p>

<p>
But man this driving distance in this terrain, yes even if its 2km, is just so painful with only 8k liter grain trailer. Sure its my fault, why not get semi-truck and super-b (although I don't think fs25 has super-b, there was some other big trailer), but yeah that cost a lot of money heh.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T18:28:07Z And the next load is sold, OK I'm not going to play-by-play these, I'll mention when its all done.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T18:44:09Z Was driving back crossing a bridge, fell asleep and DOINK! hit the bridge fence gate then, ouch. Yeah slightly tired again and this boring mundane driving around in little girlie men 2km terrain, that claustrophobic piece of trash they call fs25 riverbend springs is not exactly my idea of fun. Man, I cannot wait to get giants editor v10 and start creating my own large american terrains, it will be so glorious.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T18:47:44Z Last 8k liter oats grain load dumped, total harvest income now from finances screen: 74.8k. Actually didn't I say yesterday that most likely this grain haul profit is around 70k, was pretty accurate estimate, nice.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 275k. Saved game before driving back to my farm yard. While driving back I stopped by the dealership auto repair place and sold farmtech edk 650 trailer, I am not going to use 8k liter capacity trailers in this savegame anymore.
</p>

<p>
Then also drove john deere 3650 with amazone spreader back to the farm yard, on the way refilled last remaining solid fertilizer big bag into the spreader. Saved game. Now everything is good to go for next year time acceleration, but now I feel so tired I need to ALT-TAb again to chill a sec for web browsing and mod checking.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:18:23Z Okay all done, now back to farming and next years soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0930hrs saved game just in case something goes wrong with the upcoming soybeans planting season with all the planned leasing and such.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0521hrs good morning little girlie men 2km terrain, I would ask how are ya but I just don't like you <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay next is a big shopping spree, well leasing actually. Yeah I thought about in the last minute about taking a bank loan and buying my own stuff but nah, I'll just lease big equipment that I need, get the job done and return stuff. Interesting to see how expensive this will get for me.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0523hrs when I was typing the above paragraph with game running in real time, snow came up, huh what? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Its currently +11C temperature, so hmm not sure what kind of giants children fantasy snow is this but its not very realistic.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:32:40Z Started fertilizing F05, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:35:00Z Finished fertilizing F05.
</p>

<p>
While fertilizing that field it was snow on the ground, which then started to disappear as the field stage switch wave passed through. This is... very scary because if it takes this long, this slow, on piece of crap 2km terrain I cannot even imagine how long it will take on huge 40km terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:36:19Z Started fertilizing F04, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:37:44Z Finished fertilizing F04.
</p>

<p>
Man it truly wont take long with this 42m wide amazone spreader and 18km/h speed.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:38:46Z Started fertilizing F03, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:41:12Z Finished fertilizing F03.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:41:38Z Started fertilizing F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:44:58Z Finished fertilizing F02.
</p>

<p>
That's it, first layer of fertilization done.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T19:50:46Z Saved game and exited fs25, need to add a mod I got from jdunn1019 last night, vaderstad nz extreme cultivator configured to be plow, that is what I need to get these fields plowed quickly and american style.
</p>

<p>
Well I checked the vaderstad nz extreme 1425 but jdunn1019 configured it for 55km/h speed which is ridiculous, hmm I wonder if I could slow the steering assist down with cruise control, hmm I need to try that.
</p>

<p>
I added vaderstad nz extreme configured as plow now to PMC mod-set, will have to drive manually to avoid the unrealistic speed and besides this is just a lease - field work - return, quick setup so should be OK.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T20:24:26Z FS25 back up and running with nz extreme 1425 configured as plow, this is going to be the tool I'm using to plow my fields which also helps to avoid weeds this time, so perfect setup. This plow requires over 400hp so need to get some powerful tractor.
</p>

<p>
Hmm I need to lease that plow, obviously, then powerful 400hp possibly 500hp or over tractor, decent size planter for soybeans most likely kinze 4905, hmm then what... hmm isn't that all, I don't focus on harvest season yet, I just want to quickly stamp soybeans down.
</p>

<p>
NZ Extreme 1425 plow lease costs are, base costs: 2.5k, per work day: 1.2k, per work hour: 2.6k. Its interesting that you have per day lease cost but also per work hour, so if you don't use it much then you don't pay as much. But why would anyone lease anything and not use it when it just burns money in the vehicle shed.
</p>

<p>
Fendt 1167 vario mt lease costs are, base costs: 10.8k, per work day: 5.4k, per work hour: 11.3k.
</p>

<p>
Kinze 4905 blue drive lease costs are, base costs: 4.9k, per work day: 2.4k, per work hour: 5.2k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T20:32:57Z Leasing complete JUST when my alarm went off for a lunch break, yes this is extremely smart, LEASE crap in-game and then go having a bite to eat <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But I'll heat up the oven 12min, then cook/bake food for 5min, then eat and after that my hands are free to farm again. In the mean time I'll refill kinze 4905 with seeds and drive all equipment to my farm yard.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 3 big bags of seeds for 3.7k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T20:43:38Z Refilled kinze 4905 then drove it to the farm yard, then picked up nz extreme 1425 plow and drove it to the farm yard as well, now I'm ready for field work.
</p>

<p>
But just as I had everything setup on the field for plowing, alarm went off, its oven baking time and now I'm too busy, so decided to wait for farming before feeding time is over.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:17:51Z Feeding time is over, now back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Ahh finally I get to start plowing, the plan now is to do it all manually because they are small fields relative to the digger/ripper size and because this beta version of jdunn1019 made nz extreme 1425 has that 55km/h ridiculous speed, I cant have AI hired worker go with that speed, I don't do unrealistic farming.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:19:12Z Started plowing F05, manually.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T2120.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T2120.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:23:55Z Finished plowing F05.
</p>

<p>
Yeah this plow would go 55km/h if there was high speed tractor to pull it, so I set my cruise control to 15km/h speed, that sounds realistic for a digger/ripper of this size.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:24:57Z Started plowing F04, manually.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:28:01Z Finished plowing F04.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:28:41Z Started plowing F03, manually.

</p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:44:50Z Finished plowing F02.
</p>

<p>
That's it, digger has done its job, now its up to the planter to take over. Or not so fast, need to put down second layer of fertilizer first.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:49:28Z Started fertilizing F05, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T21:50:45Z Finished fertilizing F05.

</p>

<p>
Now amazone spreader only has 372 liters of seeds left, need to go refill at the dealership.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 3 big bags of solid fertilizer for 5.7k. Then refilled amazone seeder before heading back to my farm yard.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T22:01:55Z Started fertilizing F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T22:05:54Z Finished fertilizing F02.

<p>
Ready for soybeans seeding, but first, a restroom break.

</p>

<p>
Soybeans planting season is complete! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Then returned leased vehicles. Saved game to lock in progress. Next is a question, should I do fertilizing and bale wrapping perhaps baling contracts until reaching soybeans harvest season, or should I just time accelerate there as quickly as possible. I need to buy a grain trailer as that is required for harvest season.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T22:50:27Z Accepted contract fertilizing F07.
</p>

<p>
It was right next door to my farm yard, to get done.
</p>

<p>

<p>
2024-11-13T22:54:15Z Finished contract fertilizing F07, collected reward 3.6k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 214.2k. Saved game and after restroom break time acceleration commences until soybeans harvest season begins.
</p>

<p>
May in-game 0911hrs green plants sprout out now, FS25 has soybeans now in rows, I guess this is the row crop mod style which seems to got pretty popular lately in FS22. Looks good, not very repetitive looking in any angle I tried to look at it. Sure in N-S direction it is a little bit but well still looks OK to me.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0928hrs another growth stage kicked in, green plants look good, I like them. Giants have put good effort for these models and textures.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0826hrs its now soybeans harvest season and my crop is ready to harvest. Great, time to harvest, but first have to buy a grain trailer. DOH! I just realized that I should have checked the dealership sales every day through time accelerating, just in case if there ws a trailer for sale, but oh well.

<pre>
- trailer 34k liters brantner dd 24073/2 xxl 47.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above list, budget now 167.9k.
</p>

<p>
Took challenger mt635 and went to pickup my new grain trailer, oh this is so nice with 34k liter capacity compared to that old 8k puny little one. Should be no problem hauling some soybeans with this one.

That's it, soybeans harvest season is over! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Parked combine harvester away in a vehicle shed, dumped new branter grain trailer 31.2k liters of soybeans into farm grain bin and parked challenger mt635 with the grain trailer by the shed. Saved game. Okay, now just time accelerating until soybeans highest selling day. Although another planting season comes before that, hmm so hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm going to take a quick breather here again, just walk around a bit stretch my legs and then check web for updates etc. Also need to figure out when my days third meal is up as I forgot to put timer on.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T01:09:43Z Break is over, although that third meal is roughly 30-45min away, but I actually want to continue farming now, growing my farm is on my mind, even though this is crappy little 2km non american looking american terrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
With time acceleration the next seasonal event is next year apr soybeans planting season, then soon after jun is soybeans best selling price day. Hmm guess I'm going to do the same lease thing again to get soybeans into the ground before the best selling day, or maybe I'll skip them dunno. Luckily with one day seasons config it wont take long to get there.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0928hrs was contemplating what to do in-game tomorrow when soybeans planting season begins and while spending few minutes just thinking... snow appeared on the ground on that extremely slow field stage change pass. This is truly scary to think that if the field stages change this slowly on 2km terrain then I don't think large terrains run on fs25 because they are notoriously slow to field stage update.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, guess its time accelerating until in-game tomorrow, then lease another set of equipment, a big cultivator, tractor and the same kinze 4905 blue drive planter.
</p>

<p>
Actually I'm going to fertilize my fields now, plenty of time to use in-game today. Although that snow on the ground kind of messes up my mood for fertilizing.

<p>
2024-11-14T02:08:19Z Feeding time is over, now last part of todays farming session begins, one more soybeans harvest, lets get it done.
</p>

<p>
Leased cultivator 630hp 18.3m 11km/h summers superchisel cp2050, base costs: 3.2k, per work day: 1.6k, per work hour: 3.4k.
</p>

<p>
Leased tractor 778hp 40km/h case ih steiger 715 quadtrac, base costs: 13.7k, per work day: 6.8k, per work hour: 14.3k.
</p>

<p>
Leased Kinze 4905 blue drive, base costs: 4.9k, per work day: 2.4k, per work hour: 5.2k.
</p>

<p>
That steiger 715 is a beast, same as summers superchisel, some big boy equipment. But man that 11km/h speed on superchisel scares me. Going to give a good play through for these vehicles so manual driving.

That's it, another soybeans planting season is done! Well OK I would need to herbicide spray as I didn't rip the fields this time, but well I'm not going to do that.
</p>

<p>
Drove steiger 715 to the farm yard (dunno why, really), then returned leased vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Hmm in Mar leasing costs were 67k, yikes. Now I'm starting to get that same feeling I had back in 2021 with FS22 New Farmer game-mode savegame, I recall the case ih axial flow combine leasing bled me dry before I let it go. So yeah, leasing and bank loans are killers with the fees and payments stuff. Stick to regular good old hard work, field work or contracts or both in combination.
</p>

<p>
No more leasing, now I need to get out of this hole, but in couple of in-game months its jun for best soybeans market price and I get to sell my grain, that should give me a nice boost in the budget.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0904hrs its best market price day for soybeans, at the moment its 3612, good enough for me, going to load my grain to the trailer and off to grain barge terminal 1.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T03:59:08Z Sold 31.2k liters of soybeans at grain barge terminal 1 for 112.8k. Budget now 208.3k.
</p>

<p>
Hmm well yeah, not sure what my expectations were but that two hundred grand doesn't feel like much, no way to purchase any new vehicles and equipment.
</p>

<p>
Drove challenger mt635 back to the farm yard and now time acceleration continues for soybeans harvest season, would be great to get that done today, it might even leave me with little bit of free time before bed time, I could do some queued computer chores. But anyways that's for later, now off to harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0905hrs its soybeans harvest season, my crops are ready to harvest. Lets get started.

Yield felt like really bad with weeds, went to check F04 and it shows yield bonus 77% needs rolling and has weeds (large). But yeah, I chose not to herbicide spray as I don't have equipment so take the hit.

<p>
I am all done for today, was a great day of farming, managed to have two soybean harvests, nicely done. Now I'm going to switch over to chilling mode for rest of the night which looks like to be about 2hrs 15min which is kind of a lot gaming time, however there is no chance I could manage third soybeans harvest, and I'm also too exhausted of playing. Yes the plan was to play FS25 for two weeks straight with celebration junk food to go along with it, but it doesn't mean every single day has to be full 17hrs.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T05:41:24Z Saved game and exited fs25, good night.
