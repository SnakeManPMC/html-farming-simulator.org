New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

2024-11-16T14:56:54Z New farming day has started, just got up, did the mandatory computer morning chores, was sad to see right off the bat some community terrain news and still today in 2024 at FS25 release someone advertising the old outdated way of doing terrains in 2km, 4km, 8.1km and 16.3km sizes, man such crap just makes you want to sigh in pain. Anyways, decided to fire up FS25 for some more farming perhaps just to escape that crap heh dunno.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 64hrs 28min on it.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0854hrs grass fields are ready to harvest, so why not, going to get another silage baling harvest done, getting some money and spend two or so hours (just guessing) of this morning, then see where this day will go.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T15:08:16Z Started mowing grass F05, manual GPS.

<p>
It started to rain moment later after my mower hit the grass, was too ... hmm not sure what, but something to not stop and time accelerate to skip the rain, guess you can mowe and bale grass in the rain.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T15:28:52Z Finished mowing grass F05.
</p>

<p>
Decided to eat days first meal here, on top of usual farmsim community idiots I don't want to be bothered by starving, so yeah getting something to eat, then grass harvest continues...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T15:51:31Z Feeding time is over, back to grass mowing.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T15:52:23Z Started baling grass F05, manual GPS. see below.

<p>
2024-11-16T16:07:48Z Started wrapping grass bales F05. see below the next UTC timestamp.
</p>

<p>
Took a restroom break with slight extension as I was reading stupid people running their mouth on giants discord editing channel, its baffling to me to see people talk about 2, 4, 8.1 and 16.3 kilometer terrains even on 2024 after I've provided documentation for years, like those terrain sizes are the only ones that can be done, its just face palm disappointing head shaking kind of thing to see. I should not have returned to discord, its such a lame place, a nest of newbies and idiots. Yes of course there are exceptions, people who know what their doing etc but often times these newbies and idiots are who take the front stage there so to speak, I guess experienced guys keep to themselves or at least not say anything stupid, guess that is the nature of being experienced. Anyways, I should stay away from discord, it was a mistake to go back to that manure hole, but I am/was just so excited about new farmsim game release that it somehow felt like I have to check giants and other farmsim discord servers. The original reason I returned to discord couple of weeks back was me getting into <a href="https://sea-power.pmctactical.org" target="_blank">Sea Power</a> beta testing team, unfortunately the beta happens in discord so there was no other option.
</p>

<p>
Anyways. Back to grass baling.

<p>
At this point I realized I messed up copy-paste UTC timestamps, above there I said started wrapping grass bales F05, that is FALSE, that is indeed ... hmm I don't even know how did I mess that up so bad, I guess I meant to say there that started MOWING F02 instead, hmm yeah that sounds about right, sigh. I now added correction there but too lazy or bothered to start actually fix it.
</p>

<p>
Actually I'm blaming the manure hole discord for this, I was too distracted and frustrated by the average farmsim community idiots there. I truly should stay away, but well dunno, mark this down to the new farmsim game release enthusiasm.

<p>
2024-11-16T17:37:20Z Had to shut off twitch live stream and wont be checking discord for a while now, its just getting too much, I cant stand that stupidity in my farming session right now, just going to focus on baling F02 for now, in peace and quiet.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T17:42:22Z Baler net rolls are empty, need to drive to the dealership to refill some more, I should still have few rolls in the packet I purchased yesterday. Again, I have to admit that while I'm all for realism, this kind of "dumb" baler roundbale net rolls refilling just feels like an unnecessary grind added to the already grindy time sink game.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T17:48:41Z Finished baling grass F02.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T17:50:06Z Started wrapping grass bales F05.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T18:13:46Z Now bale wrap rolls are empty, current bale got stuck in the equipment and cannot be released/dropped, so I have to reload rolls before it continues, I'll probably going to lose this bale as I will go to the dealership and change the config type of this wrapper to use white wrap roll color so bales are easy to spot on the fields.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-16T1813.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-16T1813.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
But then I hit R key to refill wrap and it... worked, huh what? I don't get it, did it refill it from the thin air? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm or does the bale wrapper machine carry like huge numbers of those on the side, like extra magazines are for your personal firearm, hmm no idea. Or is this some sort of AI hired worker automatically buy fertilizer/seeds. No idea, this is all new to me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways continuing wrapping.
</p>

<p>
Around in-game 1230hrs rain had ended.

<p>
2024-11-16T18:47:47Z Closed firefox tabs for discord and twitch, I'm so had it with that stuff again, maybe I'm just physically tired and I know I'm locally mentally tired for that, not sure if a good nap would cure all this, guess there is no cure of seeing idiots being themselves but yeah anyways, browser now only has my HTML copy-paste notes and giants developer network open, will refresh that page every now and then just in case giants editor v10 would be released on weekend, I highly doubt it but it doesn't hurt to check. Anyways I'll probably have to take a nap soon, getting more and more physically tired here.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-16T18:57:24Z Finished wrapping grass bales F02.
</p>

<p>
Okay technically speaking that is it, I don't have to do anything else before the best market price day, I could just leave the wrapped bales in the fields and collect them when I want to sell them. But I'll collect them anyways, this time though I'll store them to middle of the farm yard or other very easily accessible place, that backyard forest from yesterday was a horrible place to pick them up.

<p>

<p>
Oh wow that took minute and a half since I launched this savegame, should have done before the nap hehe. Grass harvest ie silage baling operation is over now, next up is to wait for either the next harvest season or may which is silage best market price day. Hmm I believe the years second grass harvest comes up first, it should. I am not sure how I feel about it right now, do I want to do yet another grass harvest right after another, hmm. Going to see how this after nap "day begins" I guess.
</p>

<p>
Yes I did open those two demonic websites and are browsing through them, I already saw some negative toxic idiotic farmsim community stuff there, but hopefully it was just a random person and more better editing and other mod info would surface by reading more, I doubt it but always have to have hope.

All field work done, now just have to wait for the next grass harvest season. I might be an eye out for any contracts I could do at this point, heck I might even try some of those odd new ones like logging or whatever they were, will have to see what is available and comes up.
</p>

<p>
Checked contracts board and it was fairly interesting, had several baling related contracts, one useless 360 paying bale wrapping and then another just over a thousand, then bunch of baling contracts which few of them I could do with my own equipment, one of the biggest paid 17k which is now my highscore of contract rewards so I'm definitely going to do that just for the sake of it.

Quick jobs, nicely done (not). Okay before I continue doing contracts I need to get something to eat, I'm starving here as it usually goes after a (long) nap. So going to pre-heat the oven for 12mins and then its 5min cooking/baking and then feeding time...

<p>
Well mostly, I'm kind of stuck not watching but "monitoring" one live stream, also going to check new mods in modhub.us and anywhere else that might have them saturday night. Farming will continue in few moments.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-17T00:59:26Z Okay now I'm back, farming continues, more contracts. I actually found one contract mod that removes the limit for having max 3 active contracts, oddly enough I didn't have that issue yet, I just take one contract at the time.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-17T01:00:44Z Accepted contract baling F24, borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Well I screwed that up, meant to do that contract with my own vehicles but mistakenly read the wrong bale type so thought I cant do this with own vehicles, but its roundbale, for that I do have equipment, oh well technically speaking I'm closer to the field this way with borrowed vehicles heh.

Paid off 50k of bank loan. Now remaining bank loan 30k and budget whopping 1k. Next up time accelerating to most likely until my own grass fields are ready to harvest, so going to get that done which takes another... was it less than two hours, don't know.

Jul in-game 0826hrs many contracts disappeared, overnight loan interest was 100 even, not too bad. Grass is growing.
</p>

<p>
Aug in-game 0913hrs grass is ready to harvest, going to take artificial restroom break so I can stretch my legs a bit, then starting another silage baling operation.

2024-11-17T05:15:21Z Baler ran out of roundbale net rolls, I used R key to refill it, that deducted -200 from my bank account. Okay so... is that some sort of game settings cheat that you can just miracle alike refill rolls to it? I have no idea <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways baling continues, only outer most headland to do, almost there.

<p>
Baling phase is done, good stuff. I'm feeling slightly exhausted for this grass stuff now and I still have wrapping which is slow and then somewhat speedy collecting left.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and now its my lunch break...

<p>
2024-11-17T06:00:30Z Ran out of bale wrap, used F1 hotkey menu R to refill, it brought up the dialog to choose which wrap type, I chose white, then it loaded it "bale wrap 12/12" full and deducted -1.2k from my bank account. I still have no idea if this is a cheat or game-play mechanic by design thing. Hmm guess I can live with it, but it kind of feels like a cheat when you just make things appear in your equipment.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, bale wrapping continues.

<p>
The hard work is now done, collecting bales and hauling them for sell is quite easy. But best market price for silage is on may so that is next year stuff.

<p>
Another silage baling operation complete, well minus the selling final climax, but as said that will be next year. Same feeling as yesterday, I'm all tapped out for silage baling now, I absolutely will not do another grass harvest season in this gaming session, no way man. However switching over to soybeans again is kind of like... just to avoid my boredom and the repetitive grass grind... is kind of excessive, I cant jump back and forth everytime I get bored. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate to silage best market price and sell these piles of silage round bales.
</p>

<p>
Hmm although, if I don't fertilize spray the grass now then next harvest would be 50% fertilized state and that would be pretty bad, this silage baling operation is quite extensive work, you do not want to do it if the grass is not in perfect condition. So guess I'll get that fertilizing done just in case tomorrow I would like to do one more grass harvest... hmm or dunno, I just feel so exhausted and bored for silage baling now, maybe this in fact would be a good time to switch back into soybeans, would be the first time with this big F05 merging thing too, hmm. Yeah, I'm going to do that, next year its back to regular grain crops! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay time accelerating commences, I got some silage bales to sell.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0931hrs silage selling price at biogas plant is 373 which is pretty good for fs25, I'm going to sell now. Will be a nice finish for the previous harvests.

<p>
2024-11-17T08:24:24Z Sold case ih puma 260 tractor for 167.2k, budget now 468.4k.
</p>

<p>
I hate that puma 260 engine sound it sounds like a jet engine whine, also that tractor has useless steering turning radius, its extremely difficult and annoying tractor to drive, so had to sell it off.
</p>

<p>
Okay now I'm good to go, nothing to do here and I want to stop playing fs25 for tonight, I'll chill rest of the night and actually start to put this story into my website, not sure if that happens today but preparation work begins for sure. Tomorrow... err, heh I have no idea what day today is, its either monday or sunday morning. Oh checked calendar and its sunday, so yeah still one day of fairly sure waiting time before Giants Editor v10 might be released, monday is the soonest I would expect it, but most likely it will be on tuesday best chance of getting the release, then my New Farmer Riverbend Springs savegame gets halted as I begin studying fs25 terrain editing. But you never know how bored I get, sunday will be a long day and then also monday, who knows what going to happen.
</p>

<p>
Anyways for now, I'm signing off and plan on doing some HTML web work etc, will be fun to catch up for everything I missed since nov 12th when fs25 released.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-17T08:30:40Z Saved game and exited fs25, cu next time.
