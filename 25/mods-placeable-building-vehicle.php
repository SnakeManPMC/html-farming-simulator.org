	<h1>Mods Placeable Building Vehicle - PMC Farming Simulator 25</h1>

<p>
Placeable Building Vehicle mods for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25). Vehicle sheds, shelters, garages, workshops. A place where you store vehicles, implements and other farm yard equipment you don't want to be laying in the yard in open weather elements (rain, snow, etc). In regarding farming simulator GAME, a properly done vehicle shed 3D model has view geometry occluder which increases your performance as vehicle/implement 3D models inside the shed cannot be seen from outside therefore saving all the video card (GPU) power required to render them. Using vehicle sheds in farmsim games is role-playing, it has no functionality in-game, sorry to be blunt but that is how it is, you can park your vehicles anywhere you want and there are no game-play penalties (well unless its growing crop field), however most of the community players like to park vehicles/implements into sheds just like real life farmers, plus with properly done vehicle shed you save GPU/game performance on busy farm yards.
