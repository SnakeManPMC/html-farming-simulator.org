	<h2>2024-11-09 Setting Up Mod Directories</h2>

<p>
2024-11-09T18:11:00Z Finished creating C:\FS25.Mods\ directory which contains empty directories for _Storage, Dev, PMC and Quarantine categories, then copied over FS22 bat files to symlink, copy, start farmsim etc into this dir and edited all of them to fit current situation, mostly FS22 replaced with FS25 and all existing mods removed or REM'ed out as there are no mods for FS25 yet. Hopefully I get to populate these batch files and dirs very soon after nov 12th when first (good) mods come out <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Note that all this so far has been work on PMC DevSurf computer (nvidia GTX 1060 3gb), this is my daily editing and surfing computer. I think today, well probably right after typing this, I'll switch over to PMC Gaming computer (nvidia RTX 3060 12gb) and install FS25 there as well with these empty dirs and batch file updates. Now that I created those bat files they only need to be copied to Gaming computer, they are good to go, all the same dirs work there.
</p>

<p>
Just a small update when I'm waiting for nov 11th 2300hrs with anticipation here, man its a mere 2 days, 3 hours and 40-some minutes until my wake up call which is one hour prior to release time. Hopefully everything goes by that schedule <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
2024-11-09T18:26:00Z FS25 install is now running on PMC Gaming computer.
</p>

<p>
Finished sometime later and completely forgot the computer running behind my back (literally, 180 degrees from me, well ok 175 maybe), so it ran like hour maybe more before I got up for a restroom break and was shocked as Gaming computer was running, THAT easy it is to get lost in Sea Power studying, HTML web writing etc heh. Anyways as I'm typing this hours later FS25 has been installed and C:\FS25.Mods\ bat files have been unpacked. Its good to go, just need to wait for nov 11th 2300hrs for the serial key activation.
