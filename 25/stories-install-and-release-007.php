	<h2>2024-11-17 Install Conclusion</h2>

<p>
2024-11-17T20:11:00Z New FS25 installing day has started hehe. So I have been playing 17hrs/day until yesterday when I called it an early day, but basically you could summarize it saying that through nov 12th to 16hrs I played 17hrs/day every day. Yesterday was the first time I felt bored in mapUS riverbend springs but it most likely was caused just by excessive grass silage baling operation.
</p>

<p>
Now its time to run FS25 first time in PMC DevSurf computer, activate it and see if it even starts with Nvidia GTX 1060 3gb video card. I hope it will but you never know, especially now that I've seen what pixel porno FS25 improvements are, I mean the vehicles and implement, graphical effects on vehicles look superb, environment still looks like crap, the usual farmsim game story.
</p>

<p>
My plan has always been to edit FS25 using editing computer, and play using, yes you guessed correctly, using Gaming computer, so would be awesome if my GPU would run FS25, I cant recall there being any new tech used which would not be supported by my GTX 1060, but you never know.

2024-11-17T20:18:00Z Launched default farming simulator 25 windows desktop shortcut, game update etc dialog came up, asked serial, I copy-pasted mine, it went through fine and then game launched, I got into main menu, excellent! Now PMC DevSurf has Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) installed and working! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Next up is to configure C:\FS25.Mods\ dir with game.xml, gameSettings.xml and inputBindings.xml along with game log.txt file. I don't think there is anything to comment on these so I'll skip all that stuff.
</p>

<p>
In fact... there is nothing more to say about this FS25 install and release story, it has now been done, purchased, downloaded, installed, activated and played <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
