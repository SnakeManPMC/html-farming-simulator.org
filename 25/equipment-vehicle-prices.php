	<h2>Medium</h2>

<p>
Medium vehicle fleet is something you would upgrade to or perhaps buy with farm-manager type game-mode, perhaps. These vehicles are smallest / cheapest possible but still enjoyable and powerful enough to get the job done within reasonable time.

	<h2>Expensive</h2>

<p>
Now this is where we start to have some fun and do large scale farming with biggest, most powerful and widest vehicles possible.
</p>

<p>
When you got to do big boy large scale farming you absolutely should get some addons / mods which increase your farming capability big time. Although its worth to note that FS25 is focusing on small scale farming, just tiny farms for european/british style, if you want large scale American farming then play either FS19 or FS22.
