<p>
New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

	<h2>2024-11-12 Day Two of FS25 Game-play</h2>

<p>
2024-11-12T16:13:38Z New farming day has started. Just woke up, did the mandatory computer morning chores, skipped all FS25 news stuff, just made one reply to PMC Tactical Forum about farmlands, then started PMC Gaming computer up and now loaded FS25 savegame up.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 9hrs 17min on it.
</p>

<p>
Its now in-game aug 1721hrs, still daylight out, budget now 116.4k. Guess its to check contracts board but what I recall from last night there are nothing worth doing, so I might as well time accelerate to soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
Well I have fields to plow first, but no money to buy a proper plow, not that there is even are one in-game FS25.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T16:57:58Z Downloaded first FS25 mods, its crazy that its the day zero here or day one how its supposed to be said and there are already pretty decent mods out heh.
</p>

<p>
Now would be the place to test mods I guess, so hmm I'm going to do that, just a bulk check log and delete for all error mods, then move on quickly. No actual thorough testing, just basic errors.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and exited fs25, just clocked in few minutes of in-game savegame time while downloading mods <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T17:08:38Z Setup Quarantine mod dir, moved all new downloaded mod zips there, then launched FSG Mod Assistant, it gave no errors on anything, then launched FS25 and just got to main menu and already FS25_Fed_Produktions_Pack gives errors haha, delete. TireTracks.zip is not a mod, so delete.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly none of the remaining mods gave errors in-game FS25 so guess they are going into my _Storage mod directory now. First day, first mods, nice.
</p>

<p>
Activated C:/FS25.Mods/PMC/ mod-set now.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T17:27:27Z FS25 booted back up with all those new mods after symlinking them into PMC mod-set, and now before game has even fully loaded, I'm going to eat days first meal, I'm starving...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T17:57:03Z Feeding time is over, back to FS25.
</p>

<p>
Was chatting a bit with jdunn1019 through discord private messages into his twitch stream (yeah, long story). Okay then it was time to start farming, that's why I'm here after all heh.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:06:46Z Accepted contract fertilizing F24, F25, F79.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:10:44Z Started contract fertilizing F24, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:15:08Z Ran out of fertilizer in NW region of the terrain, so now need to travel all the way to the dealership for a refill and back.
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership and refilled two remaining big bags of solid fertilizer, then purchased 3 big bags of solid fertilizer for 5.7k, budget now 110.7k. Finished refilling and when driving towards F24 environment got darker, like a light switch was flicked.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:24:00Z Back in F24 fertilizing.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:26:50Z Finished contract fertilizing F24, collected reward 12.2k.
</p>

<p>
Oh that was a nice reward considering this is giants little girlie men terrain lovers 2km piece of crap trrain <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:28:08Z Started contract fertilizing F25, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:31:03Z Finished contract fertilizing F25, collected reward 5.1k.
</p>

<p>
Next field was then other side of this tiny terrain.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:36:26Z Started contract fertilizing F79, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T18:37:33Z Finished contract fertilizing F79, collected reward 1.8k.
</p>

<p>
That was the last available fertilizing contract, budget now 129.9k. Currently I haven't even checked what kind of plows, diggers/rippers are there in the dealership but I pretty much know they suck as its giants euro trash stuff. I'm thinking that easiest game-play way is to just ignore the fields need plowing red color for this upcoming planting season, sure I'll take a yield hit but its just better to do it like that instead of trying to hammer out more contracts for a new tractor and a plow especially if giants default stuff doesn't even have one.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then a restroom break before continuing...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:06:09Z Hmm its now aug in-game 1942hrs, night has falled, or well that disgusting "full moon every day glow in the dark" night as giants fantasy world for young children has them setup. So need to time accelerate to well at least in-game tomorrow daybreak but most likely to next year soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
Sep in-game 0901hrs used the farmhouse sleep trigger to sleep into 0900hrs, its pretty neat to choose the time from the menu instead of manually do it yourself by SHIFT-R for instant x5000 time compression, but yeah overall though its an overkill to have a farmhouse just for skipping nights, I don't appreciate that 0900hrs scheduled wake up call that much.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:18:52Z Accepted contract fertilizing F30 and F66.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:28:33Z Started contract fertilizing F66, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:29:22Z Finished contract fertilizing F66, collected reward 1k.
</p>

<p>
Man these tiny fields, almost not worth the drive over there and back. I need my own terrains so bad... <i>so, so</i> bad <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:35:59Z Accepted contract fertilizing F37.
</p>

</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T19:41:44Z Finished contract fertilizing F37, collected reward 4.3k.
</p>

<p>
Drove john deere 3650 with the spreader back to my farm yard and saved game. OK more time acceleration to skip days, next up is dec and jan, those are canola and wheat best market price selling days. Not that I have much of grain but still, gotta get it sold for money.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0900hrs. Hmm nothing interesting going on, so guess its more time accelerating. Nov in-game 1016hrs used normal 7 and 8 keys time acceleration now with a new mod I installed earlier, this was hmm I think x2400 speed. Now there is bale wrapping contracts, thats pretty good, will take those with borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:04:00Z Accepted contract baling F45, borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:07:56Z Started contract baling F45, manual driving.

<p>
<i>Edit 2024-11-27T22:00:24Z, hmm I think there was a wrong copy-paste string used here, this is clearly bale WRAPPING instead of baling, oh well.</i>
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:13:42Z Finished contract baling F45, collected reward 4.6k.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Budget now 151.7k, broke the magical 150k level, oh wow you didn't have to do x50k levels in FS22 <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:31:12Z Accepted contract fertilizing F62, F72.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 3 big bags of solid fertilizer for 5.7k, budget now 145.9k. Then refilled amazone spreader before heading to the fields.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:36:32Z Started contract fertilizing F62, manually GPS.

</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T20:46:54Z Finished contract fertilizing F72, collected reward 9.5k.
</p>

<p>
Drove john deere 3650 with amazone spreader back to the farm yard, then was ready to skip days towards soybeans planting season, oh no wait, its the canola and wheat selling days before that, dec and jan, right right.
</p>

<p>
Switched into challenger 635 tractor, hooked it up with farmtech edk 650 trailer, loaded all my canola into the trailer and then off to the selling point, its grain barge terminal 2.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-12T2120.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-12T2120.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Got 13.2k profit from selling the canola 6.1k liters or something like that. Budget now 170.5k.
</p>

<p>
Man, I want to go back to FS22, play with some big vehicles, big terrains and big profits <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm I got 2.9k liters of wheat in the grain bin so I'm not going to even bother selling it. As I just said above, the way that riverbend springs sucks, the lack of large scale farming vehicles and no fields just farmlands, I'm not sure if is me just being tired after only 4hrs sleep last night but I have almost no enthusiasm to play fs25 right now. All the passion just like I had back in 2021 with fs22 release is gone, none of it is here. Even yesterday when just starting I was still motivated to get this done, but now I'm just wondering why in the world would I continue playing this mickey mouse terrain savegame... <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
One thing really disappoints me and oddly enough this is not giants/fs25 fault at all, is how I let myself get hyped and prepared for fs25 release. This whole plan for two weeks of junk food and good desserts with great monetary expense, it now feels like such a waste of perfectly good money and kind of time, I mean what else would I do after planning all that manure, I need to go through with it. Hmm guess I could just go back to Sea Power beta testing, hmm.
</p>

<p>
Dunno, maybe if there are some mods sprinkling out hour by hour, hopefully in the next couple of days we would get giants editor v10 so I could then start to bring over my own large american terrains into fs25, that would be nice.
</p>

<p>
So guess I just have to suck it up and get on with the program until GE is out or I ran out of fs25 celebration junk food <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
But just wanted to make a statement that I am not happy about this situation in general, yeah yesterday I just said that "I feel good/happy about fs25", well not so much today anymore, I learned so much that made me sad and every minute I play just rubs that into my face more and more.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, back to farming, what else is there...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T21:36:15Z Going to start time accelerating to soybeans planting season, that will be a bad harvest as fields are not plowed or herbicide sprayed, guess I have enough money to buy some sprayer equipment but its a strange thing but the cost of the sprayer equipment and herbicide is not covered by the increased yield in these amount of hectares on one harvest season, so its dumb to buy something like that. I'll accumulate money first, then buy more decent equipment which lasts me for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0622hrs its now corn and soybeans planting season. Time to break out great plains solid stand 1500 planter/seeder and seed some soybeans.
</p>

<p>
Aww maan, took challenger mt635 tractor, hooked it up with great plains solid stand 1500 seeder (checked, its a seeder) and it does not seed soybeans, sigh. This further makes my mood sink, I cant even get my favorite best seller crop into the ground now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Hmm only thing I could see today is; oat, long grain rice (although no idea if this can be harvested with normal header or does it need that stupid water field), peas and spinach. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Inspected seeders and planters and yes, giants moved soybeans into planters, hehe!
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T22:08:10Z At this point it was 17min until lunch break so I'll expedite it a bit and get some chow right now.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T22:41:55Z Feeding time is over, back to being sad with fs25.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T22:57:43Z Been just sitting here thinking (and watching/listening jdunn1019 discord live stream, you know fs25 stuff) and I cant help but think that without spending any money, using great plains solid stand 1500 seeder with its 4.2m or somesuch width and 12km/h speed... I will end up frustrating myself, getting bored and really regretting, getting angry even, after such useless waste of time field work tasks. However anything larger from the dealership requires higher horsepower tractor and I have no money for that. I could take out a loan, sell this great plains solid stand 1500 off, hmm yeah guess that would be one option. I just don't like loans, even in such new farmer game-mode savegames.
</p>

<p>
Heck it, I'll just go on with this hardware, try to use AI hired workers for it, maybe I can just ALT-TAB and chill on the background while AI is working. I go to this OATS planting season fully knowing I might come out frustrated, bored and slightly angry but lets see how it turns out...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:07:34Z Started seeding oats F05, AI hired worker.
</p>

<p>
First time ever in fs25 using AI hired worker, set it up for 4 headlands and starting with inner rows.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:25:52Z Hmm AI hired worker finished its work leaving two big empty streaks in the inner rows, huh why... OK doing them manually.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:30:02Z Finished seeding oats F05.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:31:07Z Started seeding oats F04, AI hired worker.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:48:50Z Finished seeding oats F04.
</p>

<p>
AI hired worker failed in this as well, left empty streaks in the inner rows.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T23:49:46Z Started seeding oats F03, AI hired worker.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T0006.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T0006.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2024-11-13T00:12:02Z Finished seeding oats F03.
</p>

<p>
Yeah AI hired workers are not working, they leave empty inner rows. OK now I have to drive to the dealership for a seed refill before starting F02 as only have 188 liters left.
</p>

<p>
Drove to the dealership, purchased one big bag of seeds, refilled and then drove back to farm yard, F02.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T00:22:43Z Started seeding oats F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
Yeah no more AI hired workers, they don't work.
</p>

<p>
It feels so stupid to seed oats with 4.2m seeder when knowing how next to nothing oats market price is. All this work and ... oh man, wonder if it even breaks 10k heh. Well maybe it will, I mean previous canola was 13k but only one fields yield, so dunno.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T00:53:06Z Finished seeding oats F02.
</p>

<p>
Sold off great plains solid stand 1500 seeder for 7.7k, it was the last time I'm using 4.2m seeder in this savegame.
</p>

<p>
Saved game and then immediately begin time accelerating to oats harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Jul in-game 0924hrs its now oat harvest season but my crops are still growing. There was no chance I would run out of harvesting time, but I still let the game run for a while just in case a new field stage change would rotate through.
</p>

<p>
Aug in-game 0911hrs oats are ready to harvest now, OK then.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T01:08:45Z Started harvesting oats F05, manually GPS.

</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T01:36:09Z Started harvesting oats F03, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
I fell asleep many times during F03 harvest, just a few seconds but yeah sudden tiredness hit me.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T01:57:15Z Finished harvesting oats F03.
</p>

<p>
Restroom break to refresh myself up, constantly falling asleep, its amazing I managed to harvest F03 without making any crop destruction mistakes.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T02:03:14Z Started harvesting oats F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T02:38:43Z Finished harvesting oats F02. Oops forgot to timestamp this, just finished driving combine harvester to the farm yard, unload and pack it away in the vehicle shed, then dumped two trailer loads of oats into farm grain bin. All done for oats harvest season.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T0238.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-13T0238.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
Its easy to say once you're at this point but guess this harvest season wasn't that bad, even though its quite small combine harvester, but next planting season definitely happens with better seeder and I want to do soybeans.
</p>

<p>
My lunch break is coming in just over half an hour, before that I want to check RSS news etc so hopefully I might spend that time until its lunch break time, so it will be almost an hour, maybe, break on farming game-play now. So extended lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T03:33:26Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
While feeding was thinking more about what to do next, well answer is very simple; upgrade my vehicle fleet, in giants style they are completely out of balance (like creating case ih quadtrac 715 tractor for 2km terrains etc), these fields while yes universally they are tiny, are still way too large for the 4m cultivator and 4.2m seeder, so vehicle fleet is greatly underpowered for the field work required for one season. So new vehicles, but I only have 177.7k budget so you wont be buying anything good with that amount. Doing more contracts is... well I wouldn't say useless but pretty close as fields are so small that contracts pay next to nothing, I believe I said earlier that such rewards are so pitiful that its almost not worth to even drive to the field and back. So universally yes contracts are the big money maker in early games, however it doesn't apply to giants (fs25) riverbend springs 2km little girlie men terrain, but I think it was the same already in fs22, I remember SGA guys releasing "mission rewards" mod or something like that which boosted the rewards up so contracts were worth doing, also lateron FS22 Better Contracts mod had the same option but I never needed it as I play on large terrains with sometimes huge fields.
</p>

<p>
I need better equipment but where do I get the money. And even more fundamental question, do I really want to push hard on this piece of manure fs25 mapUS aka riverbend springs as the terrain is so bad, hmm no, not really <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Well what then, do I stop playing or? Heh nope, don't want to do that either with my two weeks of junk food and desserts special grocery store delivery with high cost, I mean guess I can eat those doing whatever but feels such a waste if this planned two weeks goes to the dogs.
</p>

<p>
Hey at least I learned my lesson, for the next giants farmsim game release my expectations are between zero and extremely low, I will not let myself get caught in the hype and plan this kind of two week luxury celebration stuff. I mean nothing wrong with enjoying yourself, but there is always a chance that the product that is coming out will suck and then all that planning is for nothing, its almost like mocking you that <i>"ha-haa! you just bought couple of hundred euros worth of good foods and now there is nothing to celebrate!"</i> <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Lessons learned, that's for sure.
</p>

<p>
One option now is to stop playing, at least for today or until further notice and start to really dig into those mapUS files, to see if I could hack a playable terrain template for myself, if I could get object-less terrain in-game using fs25 mapUS and text editor, then I could create anykind of heightmap + cultivator_density setup for fields, that would be more than enough for me to keep happy until giants editor v10 comes out.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T03:51:13Z For a moment there got caught browsing through twitch fs25 category, nothing interesting to watch. Hmm okay so I remember from was it FS22 new farmer game-mode that when I took a loan, or was it leased case ih axial flow harvester, that was a big mistake as it bleeds money so badly, hmm I recall it was the harvester but it might have been bank loan as well. But right now with less than two hundred grand cash, I wont be buying any vehicles and equipment worth squat, so guess I have to take out loan if there is any hope to get this farm going anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
Oh btw forgot to mention, oat harvest yielded 40k liters, not bad actually. Best selling day market price is on dec and that currently is 1.8k per thousand liters, so hmm profit would be, err can I count this in my head, something like 70k maybe, yeah that oat grain sale is "nice" but doesn't help me in any way out of this jam.
</p>

<p>
Now another lower cost option of course is the leasing what I mentioned earlier, when next planting season comes I could lease big tractor, digger/ripper and planter, then get fert - plow - fert - seed done in one big push in a day, straight up no pauses no excuses. Then return the leased vehicles, that would be far more cheaper than taking out lets say one million loan for over a year probably more where the interest rate would bleed me dry.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, that might work, also I have not done that in a long time mostly because my regular <a href="../19/start-from-zero.php">Start From Zero</a> game mode savegames wont allow it.
</p>

<p>
Okay restroom break and then its no excuses decision time <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

2024-11-13T04:08:38Z Made my decision, I'm going to try creating a terrain mod out of mapUS riverbend springs, giving it decent amount of time to get to work meaning if it doesn't work right off the bat, and if I fail, then I come back to this new farmer game-mode savegame and do that last idea of leasing good equipment in next years apr when soybeans planting season begins, bright and early in the morning to save time, hell maybe I'd use the x0.5 time compression for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Okay so switching over to terrain dev diary writing now while doing that mapUS testing, its odd but I kind of expect to fail but you never know where that leads so have to write dev diary documentation right from the start.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T04:12:59Z Saved game and shutdown fs25, will be back soon I hope or well most likely.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T07:18:37Z Back, restored gameSettings.xml from the prior terrain development project setup, loaded new farmer riverbend springs savegame up and I'm now standing in the farm yard, okay, now what?
</p>

<p>
Took a refreshing shower during terrain development project work, so now I'm feeling fresh and not at all tired, I could continue playing but the question remains, for how long, I think my been awake 17hrs alarm went off over an hour ago now, so kind of scary that I'm still up and not even tired.
</p>

<p>
Plan was executed, I did the terrain dev stuff and was successful, you can read about it in PMCTODO INSERT_LINK_HERE <a href="dev-diary.php">Dev Diary FS25</a> page, which btw is my very first dev diary for FS25. So now I could continue that plan and farm some more, time accelerate to soybeans planting season and then get those leased vehicles for short compressed on time sprint to prepare my fields and seed soybeans before returning leased equipment. Not sure if I have energy left to do all that, even with good equipment. But well, one step at the time, I'm going to start time accelerating now.
</p>

<p>
But I saw a nice contract, right next to the dealership some bale wrapping, this might wrap up my day nicely heh no pun intended <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T07:26:16Z Accepted contract bale wrapping F84, borrowed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T07:28:02Z Started contract bale wrapping F84, manual driving. Oops started about 45sec ago <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T07:35:28Z Finished contract bale warapping F84, collected reward 8.2k.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 186k. I mean guess that budget slowly, painfully but slowly, is increasing when you time accelerate and grab these more profitable contracts, for example this F84 bale wrapping contract is very nice. Sure there are more paying fertilizing contract but then you have to take into account the product and also how carefully you spread the product, in comparison bale wrapping is piece of cake.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-13T07:37:58Z Saved game and exited fs25, its good night for me now. Tomorrow, guess this same continues tomorrow with new energy.
