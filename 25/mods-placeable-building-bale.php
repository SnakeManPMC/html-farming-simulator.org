	<h1>Mods Placeable Building Bale - PMC Farming Simulator 25</h1>

<p>
Placeable Building Bale mods for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25). Bale storage, basically. When you have grass bales, hay bales or silage bales, whether they are round bales or square bales, you have to store them somewhere as keeping them at side of the fields or in the farm yard or animal barns/sheds in great numbers is not such a good idea. There are various bale storage building placeables available, many of them have automated bale collecting functionality. There are also old school bale sheds or shelters where bales have to be manually stacked into the shed and can be knocked off with accidental vehicle collision.
