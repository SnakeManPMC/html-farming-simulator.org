	<h2>Switch To Gaming Computer</h2>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:14:07Z PMC Gaming computer is up, going to start updating windows 10 now.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:14:54Z Done, heh that didn't take long, it was just some virus database update, because of Sea Power beta testing I've kept my Gaming computer win10 up to date, so no real win10 crap updates, good. Okay now its just firing up firefox (hoh 'funny') and maybe that dajnet twitch live stream to keep me entertained.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:19:31Z Setup OBS captured video MP4 clips moving batch file to local area network LAN dir at PMC DevSurf, also deleted bunch of files to free something like 87gb of HDD file space. Should be good to go for recording some FS25 footage.
</p>

<p>
Updated OBS to v30.2.3, its now good to go, just need FS25 running to add a new game source, then to verify video capturing works OK.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:23:12Z But now its time to grab something to eat, I want to get into 2300hrs with a full belly so I can play at least bare minimum 4hrs 30min without feeding then heh. So a lunch break, last meal before FS25...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:38:05Z Feeding time is over, now I'm ready for FS25 release.
</p>

<p>
Still 22min to go <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Got FS25 serial key already in copy-paste clipboard, its good to go. In fact, let me try to activate it now just for the sake of it...
</p>

<p>
Nope, not working yet, startup says <i>"Activation failed. This product will only be released on 2024-11-12."</i>, okay got it, 2300hrs it is <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T22:59:41Z Almost there ...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:00:01Z Go go go! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:00:31Z FS25 startup says "Activation failed. This product will only be released on 2024-11-12." <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:05:04Z Still doesn't activate <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:07:26Z Doesn't activate, hmm hmm <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:15:02Z Few minutes ago learned in giants discord #farming-simulator_en channel that release schedule image was <i>released yesterday</i> on announcement channel, why the fuck didn't they release anything in their website, sigh <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways the release is on november 12th 2024 UTC 13:00hrs so still 12hrs 44min to go <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to try activating one more time just for the sake of it. But then I have to resort to other measures.
</p>

<p>
Okay, its not working, the schedule is true, it activates 1300hrs, fuck me <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Oh well, you gotta do what you gotta do ... why I didn't do this earlier today I don't know.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:18:45Z Going to take a restroom break, then do some background work which I cannot mention in this public farmsim story, but I should be playing in no time, will have to see how it turns out...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:30:29Z Back. Actually several minutes back but forgot to timestamp this. Been googling some issue while doing background work to get FS25 running.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-11T23:51:30Z Got FS25 running, saw intro video and main menu already, but now I need to setup _run_start_FS25.bat file to launch it properly with parameters.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:05:19Z Finished setting up start batch file for FS25 and configuring new OBS scene for FS25. Audio should be cut off so I can listen to music, youtube videos and twitch live streams to pass the time better.
</p>

<p>
You see, this is what I mean by things are not always going by the plan, its now past midnight and I'm still just configuring this stuff up. This time on farmsim game release history it was the release schedule TIME that threw me off, on both FS19 and FS22 it was midnight german time ie 2300hrs, this time its 1400hrs german time ie 1300hrs UTC. Why Giants Software changed the release TIME, you have to ask them, to me it just feels lazy like people didn't want to be in the office at midnight, which to some family men admittely is kind of awkward time to be at work, but still, a new game gets released after only 2-3 years so one night at the office wont kill you. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
Okay next up is to configure <a href="settings.php">game.xml and gameSettings.xml</a> files.
</p>

<p>
The usual game settings dir is located in C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\ dir.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:11:34Z Got notepad++ project panel setup for new FS25 dir (workspace), added game.xml, gameSettings.xml, inputBindings.xml and log.txt file there. Now I'm set.
</p>

<p>
Edited game.xml to enable dev console, both errors and warnings bring it up in-game.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:19:52Z Symlinked C:\FS25.Mods\FS25.Settings\ dir.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:23:01Z Hmm now its time to launch the game and go to the options/settings to configure video and other options.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately had to revert the dev console onWarnings= because it constantly spams the cannot connect to modhub. Then configured game.xml for my own viewdistance settings, did not activate them yet just put in the comments. Then did gameSettings.xml for mod directories, even though there are no mods yet as game has not officially released, its good to have dirs ready to go.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:38:21Z Okay once more, time to fire the game up and start configuring basic options/settings.
</p>

<p>
But I goofed something up, it loaded my FS22 mods dir now <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
This is the current game version: Farming Simulator 25 Version: 1.2.1.0 b31201
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:47:36Z Finished configuring all in-game menu options/settings.
</p>

<p>
game.xml changes for:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;scalability&gt;
&lt;performanceClass&gt;Ultra&lt;/performanceClass&gt;
</pre>

<p>
A simple video preset. Interesting to see if my RTX 3060 12gb GPU runs that even at 30FPS <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T00:52:03Z Started riverbend springs terrain new farmer game-mode! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Here I go, whee, it has begun! Yeah buddy! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:00:31Z Got in-game, performance was atrocious 15-20FPS fluctuating, FS25 feels extremely heavy on ultra settings in my RTX 3060 12gb GPU, its just way too advanced stuff for this hardware which was already not up to the bar with FS22. So I watched the granpa walter speech in the tutorial intro thing, then configured save game settings, saved game and exited, I need to configure video options to something well above 40FPS bare minimum, I want enjoyable farming experience instead of a lag fest.
</p>

<p>
FS25 in-game options menu for video settings presets are: very low, low, medium, high, very high and ultra that I just tried with awful 15-20FPS performance. So I'm going to make a baseline comparison with very low. Lets start humble.
</p>

<p>
game.xml on very low video preset:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;performanceClass&gt;Very Low&lt;/performanceClass&gt;
</pre>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:10:29Z Well initial attempt with very low video preset gave me 60FPS performance, surprisingly it didn't look like crap, sure you could tell the difference but it was not like trees and buildings turning into legos. I could actually imagine playing with that game setting. However had to exit into main menu once again to configure mouse sensitivity, the 100% speed or scale whatever it is was way too slow, increased it to 150% now.
</p>

<p>
Tested in-game 3D world and mouse speed is still too slow, had to do another main menu visit for setting mouse sensitivity to 200% which is the max on the menu slider. Now it should be good.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:14:39Z Okay now mouse feels OK and video preset very low gives me rock solid 60FPS when I walk around in the new farmer game-mode farm yard in riverbend springs. Okay this is a good base line, now I get to try next higher video preset to see when this 60FPS starts to drop. I don't think I need the pixel porno super graphics, but well sure I want to do some testing.
</p>

<p>
BTW just realized that this is now kind of officially already running the new farmer game-mode story text, but I'll keep this story as release and install story which actually is backwards, its install and release <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Once I have all settings fully placed and I'm ready to start farming, then I'll end this story and begin brand new for new farmer game-mode, first time ever game-play of FS25, cant wait! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay first experience impressions, running speed with SHIFT-W is quite low, feels really slow but maybe its just me as I use ... was going to say I use x3 speed in FS22 but do I? Hmm I'm not sure, obviously running speed and no croshairs mod is one of the stock standard mods to have but I think hmm maybe I usually run the normal speed and only when I need to run around like crazy I turn it up a bit.
</p>

<p>
I'm noticing that with vsync off, there is decent amount of screen tearing going on.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:24:07Z Changed video preset to low and restarted the game.
</p>

<p>
Still got 60FPS on the farm yard, good. Next up is video preset medium.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:34:23Z Well video preset medium gives about 51FPS on the farm yard looking through it, but once you walk into the cow pasture then it turns into 60FPS, so seems to depend a lot on how many polygons you got on the scene, so hmm guess I'll stick with this medium for now.
</p>

<p>
You know what, dunno what else do I want to configure before starting to play, I think its time to wrap this install and release story up, tomorrow 1300hrs UTC which is 1400hrs german time FS25 officially activates, so guess that might still be one more entry but hmm well hopefully I can play over 12hrs now so I don't have to close this story text down yet, I'll just switch the header <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-12T01:37:39Z Okay moving this text to another text file to wait for final conclusion at 1300hrs or after depending if I'm still awake at that time, starting a new story, cu there <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
The next page in this Install and Release story is page 7, conclusion several days later, however if you want to keep a strict time line while reading my journey through FS25 then technically speaking the next page you should read is <a href="stories-new-farmer-riverbend-springs.php">New Farmer Riverbend Springs Story</a>, however the conclusion on page 7 is a quick read so you might as well get it over with right now, then move into New Farmer Riverbend Springs story if you so wish.
