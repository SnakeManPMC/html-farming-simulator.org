	<h1>Mods Plow - PMC Farming Simulator 25</h1>

<p>
Plow mods for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25). Traditionally giants plows (ploughing) is for european or well international moldboard ploughing, Americans however don't moldboard plow fields anymore, they work the ground in general, they call these implements diggers or rippers etc few other names, it varies a bit from state to state. Giants farmsim games definitely are lagging a bit behind, it is my understand that even internationally farmers don't do much moldboard plowing as many are moving into deep cultivating or shallow cultivating type field work, feel free to correct me in PMC Tactical Forums if I'm completely off. However in a nutshell; you have to plow after cotton, corn, sugar beet and potato harvests in farmsim games, that is when ESC mapview field status changes to red "Needs plowing".
