	<h2>2024-11-11 The Night Before</h2>

<p>
2024-11-11T04:47:00Z Today sunday spend all day doing Sea Power missions while watching on the side FS25 twitch live streams, right now my day is turning into night, getting tired and I'm trying to stay up as long as possible so I could then sleep as late as possible so at 2300hrs I'm fully energized and ready to go for as many hours as possible.
</p>

<p>
However I do have to admit that after watching few days of these FS25 live streams my anticipation starts to slowly wind down, I'm sure the excitement kicks in around 2200hrs "tomorrow" but yeah I guess its the same mood as with FS22 waiting, I should have not watched all these pre-release live streams, they kind of ruin the excitement of the game for you as other people are playing and showing all the cool stuff that you are left basically nothing to discover yourself on the release moment.
</p>

<p>
Well "nothing" is quite drastic term but more or less, I have now seen the bulk of the stuff as most of these twitch streamers want to be thorough and usually even take audience requests like <i>"show this, show that"</i>, so yeah many features have been well showcased by now.
</p>

<p>
Hey who knows maybe for the next farmsim game I can live in a vacuum not watching any pre-release videos etc <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Anyways, don't get me wrong, I'm still in <i>"cant wait for serial key to activate"</i> mood, I wish I could sleep some mega 8hrs maybe even 10hrs although that would never happen, 8hrs 30min is my highscore in recent memory, so that I could skip as many hours as possible towards the release. I want to get FS25 activated so I can see if it runs on my i7 4790K, RTX 3060 12gb, 16gb RAM machine and if it does, then well then the fun part begins, to discover everything that is new, myself, by my own hands, with the context what I just said about the pre-release footage.
</p>

<p>
Come on 2300hrs, why are you so far away <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
BTW right now things suck, I could and should do some preparation HTML web work, watch more pre-release videos, these clickbait scammers (just joking) have already pushed out such blatant viewer ads revenue grabbing videos that it would be childs play to see even more new stuff, how things work etc, but yeah I'm too tired already, running on fumes now, just trying to stay up a little while longer before heading to bed.
