	<h2>2024-11-09 Downloading Farming Simulator 25</h2>

<p>
2024-11-09T00:25:00Z Download is in progress, Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) is now downloading! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah sure its just a pre-load as the serial key activates the game at midnight german time november 12th 2024, this will be for me nov 11th UTC 2300hrs.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-09T00:35:00Z Finished configuring my home Linux Ubuntu 22.04 server for samba file server with FS25 directories added there. There are now all game installers, github archives, incoming untested (mods), etc etc directories just ready and waiting for material.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm ready for FS25 release regarding my home local area network (LAN). Good stuff.
</p>

<p>
FS25 was downloading from giants server about 11-12mb/s, nice decent speed, I feel sorry for guys who had poor download speeds as I heard such stories in some live stream I had running on the background.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-09T01:00:00Z Finished downloading FarmingSimulator25_1_2_1_1_ESD.zip <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Download size is 19.5gb. First I unpacked the zip, for years I've archived all farmsim installers unpacked as they are already very tightly packed in their binary form, I don't think 7-zip packs them at all, hmm maybe I should test it again now.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-09T01:24:00Z 7-Zip finished packing FarmingSimulator25_1_2_1_1_ESD.7z but that is exactly the same as zip and unpacked, which is 19.5gb file size. No point of packing it up, well I mean it would be one file instead of 14 files unpacked, one .exe installer and 13 .bin files.

2024-11-09T01:27:00Z Started installing FS25 for PMC DevSurf computer <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Used my regular install dir setup:
</p>

<pre>
C:\Games\fs25
</pre>

<p>
2024-11-09T01:44:00Z Installer finished, now my editing/surfing computer has FS25 installed, only thing need to do now is to wait for nov 11th 2300hrs UTC for the serial key to activate <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Launched fs25 and it went to the activation screen, was thinking of trying it out for no reason I mean who knows maybe there was some giants server mistake which would allow me to activate it, but decided against it as I'm not sure if those attempts before release date count into the <i>"serial key activations exceeded"</i> count.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm going to just inspect the file structure, especially terrains and then well, back to <a href="https://sea-power.pmctactical.org" target="_blank">Sea Power</a> beta testing for rest of the night, saturday, sunday and beginning part of monday before I have to wrap Sea Power stuff up, sleep and then wake up UTC 2200hrs so I'm good to go when the game activates.
