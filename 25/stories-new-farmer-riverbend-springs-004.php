New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

	<h2>2024-11-14 Vehicle Upgrade and Equipment Purchase</h2>

<p>
2024-11-14T15:33:05Z New farming day has started, did the mandatory computer morning chores, checked for Giants Editor (GE) release for FS25, not yet. Switched over to PMC Gaming computer, checked discord and modhub.us for new mods, downloaded dozen or so and documented basic info about them. Ate days first meal just now and its time to launch FS25. Going to farm some, grow my farm.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 34hrs 46min on it.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 1035hrs, on last farming session finished soybeans harvest season, got 24.3k liters of soybeans in farm grain bin now, hmm not too much.
</p>

<p>
Plan now is not to keep doing the super expensive leasing of vehicles because it is simply not sustainable over the long run, for example "last time" that leasing was cost me 67k, now that is a good OATS harvest full profit when you sell the grain, how does it make any sense to lease that expensive vehicles just so the farming, real life GAMING TIME is a little shorter. Just spend even an hour longer per planting and harvest season to save that much money sounds like a good deal to me. So I need to buy my own equipment now, slightly larger cultivator which also means tractor, but man with my current 209.1k budget, geez not sure if I can buy anything. Man what a dilemma.
</p>

<p>
Going to time accelerate towards mar next year while monitoring contracts board and the dealership sales for opportunities.
</p>

<p>
Forgot to mention (I think) on all the previous days of playing, riverbend springs new farmer game-mode includes some <a href="../22/stories-greenhouse-production-experiment.php">money making placeables (which are a cheat)</a>, my farm makes depending on a day more or less slightly above property maintenance fees. Oh and my farm backyard have bees I think.
</p>

<p>
Went to check and there are; small solar collector, grain bin (???), 4 * beehive old and beehive (33 langstroth hives) placeables. There was one full honey pallet and second being generated. Also backyard had a small shed some kind of "constructible" or something, where I would need to bring some wood or some such material so the shed would build itself, odd.
</p>

<p>
I went through placeables in the farm yard and I could make a little bit money selling them all off, but I don't want to, yes I need money but not that bad that I would cannibalize my farm yard to the bone for money, that would be quite silly.
</p>

<p>
OK original plan continues, time accelerating towards mar while monitoring contracts board and the dealership sales.
</p>

<p>
Jan in-game 0923hrs the dealership has Bredal K105 for sale -75% off. Okay so this is a tricky offer, yes for contracts that increased capacity would definitely help me, but for my own fields the current amazone 3.2k liter capacity is more than fine as it can do all fields in one go if its full when you start. But for doing all the fertilizing contracts without worrying about needing to go refill every few fields... yes this bredal K105 would be awesome. Its price is 15.9k which is very low overall, I could even sell the amazone spreader for few thousands relief.
</p>

<p>
Decided to buy the bredal, its too good offer to pass.
</p>

<p>
Budget now 192.8k.
</p>

<p>
Sold amazone spreader (always too lazy to get its model number heh) for 11.1k, wow that was a cool deal, got almost the bredal k105 amount back.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 15.3k. Then refilled bredal k105 spreader.

<p>
First layer of fertilizer is down, next up is to cultivate but with what implement, I really don't want to go with the new farmer game-mode owned john deere 980 which is 4m width, oh my.
</p>

<p>
Wrote down all cultivators, shallow cultivators and disc harrows from giants base game equipment, for my HTML copy-paste text list. Also tried to make a plan for what cultivator do I want to buy to replace the current 4m one. But as usual, with my current budget there is no way to buy anything. Next step up from 4m JD 980 shallow cultivator would be "180hp 5m 15km/h lemken smaragd 9/500k" which would add one whopping meter to the width but also increase horsepower usage to such level that my challenger mt635 most likely could not pull it with full 15km/h speed.
</p>

<p>
Sold john deere 980 shallow cultivator for 1.3k, budget now 189.7k.
</p>

<pre>
- shallow cultivator 190hp 7.5m 15km/h kuhn prolander 7500 50.5k
</pre>

<p>
Purchased the above list, budget now 139.2k.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T18:03:39Z Saved game and exited fs25, I'm snoozing off, falling asleep, too tired with only 4hrs something sleep last night, need to go take a nap, farming continues soon ...
</p>

<p>
<b>2024-11-14T21:43:11Z</b> Back. Slept like 3hrs 18min, was more of a sleep than a nap really.
</p>

<p>
Game is up but I'm still chatting with jdunn1019 about fs25 editing and news on his live stream.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T23:29:06Z Still chatting and now I'm getting hungry, its time to take a lunch break...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-14T23:53:32Z Feeding time is over, back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Okay now my chat with jdunn1019 is over and I can fully continue playing FS25 again, finally after all these naps and hours hehe.
</p>

<p>
Actually I kind of forgot what I was doing earlier, I can see from this text story that cultivating F03 was half way done, okay time to continue it then, getting these last two fields done.
</p>

<p>
But uh oh, now I forgot to start OBS, so I need to save the game, exit fs25, start OBS and start fs25, geez, oh well gotta get done. This is assuming you cannot start OBS after the game is already running, the "hook" wont get into the game or something, at least thats how it was previously so why risk it now.

<p>
2024-11-15T00:03:28Z Finished cultivating F03.
</p>

<p>
Okay back in business <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T00:04:09Z Started cultivating F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
This new fs25 is quite interesting when it comes to vehicle specs, for example this challenger mt635 tractor, I'm wondering why does it pull this kuhn prolander shallow cultivator only 11km/h when its working speed is listed 15km/h... that is because tractor doesn't have enough horsepower (I think), so how many horses does mt635 has, well I don't know... because ESC menu finances -&gt; vehicles only list "160 - 225 hp" under there. Huh what, what is the frigging horsepower value!? English, MASSEY FERGUSON! Do you speak it!? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I'm now thinking that maybe I'll sell both john deere 3650 and challenger mt635 tractors, then buy some 300hp one, assuming I have enough money. Once this F02 cultivating field work is over I'm going to do extensive horsepower sorted list of tractors in fs25, its good to see what would be my horsepower and price range.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T00:23:10Z Finished cultivating F02.
</p>

<p>
Parked challenger mt635 with kuhn prolander 7500 shallow cultivator into the open vehicle shed with harvester, then saved game. Next up is second layer of fertilizer, but before that a restroom break...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T00:45:52Z Took care of some chat message deletions, now I'm back in-game and good to go again until next meal break in about four or so hours.
</p>

<p>
Checked the dealership tractors, the small category are on quick surface scan all below 150hp (mainly 143hp and lower unless I'm mistaken), so these are all but useless to anything other than garden weeding.
</p>

<p>
Started to dig through tractors medium, found my challenger mt635 from there, that engine gives it 160hp, OK so kuhn prolander 7500 requires 190hp so no wonder why it only does 11km/h. Will have to fix that.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T01:25:38Z Finished creating medium and large tractors list sorted by horsepower, inspecting the list now for a possible replacement for both of my current tractors.
</p>

<p>
Hmm but here comes a problem... next seasonal event is soybeans planting season, for that I need a planter, I don't have one and leasing again would cost me arm and a leg, ie around 67k (or dunno was that the semi mistake of time accelerating one day to accumulate leasing costs for no reason, hmm), anyways it would cost me dearly. However... my budget is now 139.5k so there is no way in hell I would BUY myself a planter and tractor to pull it. Oh man oh man, this is the torment of a beginner farmer <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Going to take another restroom break to contemplate my next move, I need to come up with a solution and decision before I come back <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T01:38:12Z Answer is quite easy: regular hard work with the equipment you got. There is nothing to it.
</p>

<p>
Yeah its not necessarily the answer I wanted to hear but there is no other option, leasing is a recipe to disaster and I bet taking a bank loan it not much better on the long run. Although... hmm FS19, FS22 and FS25... do they have bank loan interest that you pay daily, hmm I believe there was some nightly ie daily fees, hmm heh how cant I remember that, guess because I don't use loans other than on some strange savegames for testing purposes.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T01:49:26Z Did some googling and found one comment somewhere that FS22 loan interest is 4% not sure if that is true, also not sure if its 4% per month/season (ie 1 day with one day seasons config) or is it a year, I mean it has to be a season (day, nightly fees). Hmm anyways I do remember that lease and loan is crap, stay away from those, lease was re-confirmed yesterdays gaming session, but now I'm still almost against my better knowledge thinking about maxing out a loan to get my farm rocking and rolling.
</p>

<p>
But before making that decision I'm going to make a full list of soybean planters horsepower, width and price.
</p>

<p>
Best in-game FS25 planter is - planter 350hp 7068 liters 18.2m 18km/h direct drill kinze 4905 blue drive 249.5k the next best is probably - planter 180hp 2660 liters 9m 18km/h kverneland optima rs 89.5k which goes down in the horsepower range a lot. In fact... if I were to upgrade my challenger mt635 to mt665 I could purchase that kverneland and run my next planting season with it, hmm, might be a good choice at this point before going to take a crazy loan.
</p>

<p>
But for now I'll put second layer of fertilizer.

<p>
Next up is soybeans planting in-game tomorrow, but for that I need to buy a planter first <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
I sold off one small wooden garden shed which was hidden under some trees, didn't even realize I owned it on my farm yard, it served no purpose other than bleeding money. Was thinking of selling other farm buildings which has no vehicle shelter capacity but decided against it, like said earlier in this story I don't want to cannibalize the farm yard so it looks just empty and weird, especially as I cannot cut trees (well lets say I wont go the trouble of finding some wood chipper machine like everyone in twitch seems to be doing).
</p>

<p>
Before going wild with the bank loan I decided to upgrade challenger mt635 to 665 which gives it a nice horsepower boost, then purchase kverneland planter which gets me through soybeans planting season until I get more money for better equipment.
</p>

<p>
Upgraded it to mt665 engine and narrow twin wheels, total cost 30k. Budget now 107.6k with 225hp tractor, nice.
</p>

<pre>
- planter 180hp 2660 liters 9m 18km/h kverneland optima rs 89.5k
</pre>

<p>
2024-11-15T02:36:37Z Purchased the above list and hooked up to challenger mt665. Budget now 18.1k.
</p>

<p>
Drove my brand new shiny kverneland optima rs planter to the farm yard, refilled it with seeds... and was devastated to realize this piece of manure planter only accepts, <i>get this</i>, 660 liters of seeds! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Yeah now I remember my previous failure from was it <a href="../22/pmc-undefined-farms-20km.php">PMC Undefined Farms 20km</a> in FS22 where I made the same mistake. Why the hell doesn't giants list fertilizer and seed capacity differently on the dealership menus! Pisses me off to find out after the purchase. Well I have now documented this on my HTML copy-paste list so I will never make the same mistake ever again, lessons learned, always making progress.
</p>

<p>
Really interesting to see how many seed refills does it take to seed my current fields. Oh man, maybe it would have been just smarter business decision to get the one million or whatever bank loan and buy some big boy equipment, quit messing around and get the job done <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-15T0243.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-15T0243.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
OK then, next up is one more night time accelerating and then its soybeans planting season with my new planter. Cant wait although that 660 liter crap kind of bums me out, but hey, pay no mind to it and just walk it off.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0923hrs soybeans planting season has arrived, lets get to work.

<p>
Actually I really like this challenger mt665 and kverneland optima rs planter combo, only thing is the seed capacity but how snappy this combo moves on the (small) fields is very nice, its almost too fast with 18km/h speed heh, at least on these little girlie men fields. And of course, you would never ever in million years take a single optima rs into fields larger than single digit hectares with that puny 660 liter seed tank capacity.

<p>
2024-11-15T03:38:35Z Parked kverneland optima rs planter into the red vehicle shed, saved game and ... well now guess its just time accelerating util soybeans harvest season, oh no wait, in jun its soybeans best market selling price day so getting to sell that hmm 20k some liters I have in the grain bin.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0830hrs good morning little girlie men 2km terrain. Soybeans best market price day has arrived, time to hook up challenger mt665 with brantner grain trailer and get hauling, only 24.3k liters of soybeans but that will have to do for now. Luckily best market price selling point is grain barge terminal 2 which is right next to my farm yard, so this will be super quick grain sale.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T03:50:44Z Sold 24.3k liters of soybeans in grain barge terminal 2 for 87.6k, budget now 106k. Cool, back to one hundred grand club <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Now time accelerating continues towards soybeans harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0922hrs soybeans harvest season is here, time to get to work. This time its going to be manually GPS driven work, hopefully it goes alright (at least I recall I never used GPS with combine harvester before).

<p>
2024-11-15T04:21:48Z Massey ferguson MF 8570 combine harvester reached ZERO repair level or health whatever its called, I decided to drive to the dealership repair point and get this thing fixed, I don't know if very bad repair condition harvester lowers the yield, but I just want to get this done, and diesel refueled as well. <i>Edit 2024-12-04T15:39:01Z, there are various mentions about this online but nobody so far has given any scientific proof about crop yield lowering percentages or liters etc, everyone just seems to be speculating or throwing vague comments around. If you know proven scientific numbers how much damaged combine harvester or harvester header drops harvesting yield, please let me know in <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum</a>, thanks.</i>
</p>

<p>
It was 2.4k for header and 9.4k for the combine harvester, wow that ain't cheap! <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">

2024-11-15T04:47:44Z Alarm went off (OK was about to go off in 3min time, man my internal senses are so accurate haha) for a lunch break, so shut off MF 8570 and now its time to feast...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T05:15:02Z Feeding time is over, back to soybeans.

2024-11-15T05:57:57Z Finished harvesting soybeans F02.
</p>

<p>
It is over, another soybeans harvest is in the bin. Yield was 32k liters even. Cool.
</p>

<p>
Sold john deere pickup 1150 weight for 926 and john deere 3650 tractor for 11.8k. Budget now 106.6k. I didn't need two tractors so cashed in, I need money.
</p>

<p>
Took a quick break to check if Giants Editor v10 has been released yet as its bright and early EU time, nope it was not, so going to start fertilizing my fields. Actually... hmm I would like to plow these fields into one big field, hmm but that obviously needs a plow, hmm. Oh well too lazy to think about that now, going to just start fertilizing, another round same as usual.

That was quick and painless, took only 16min in real life time and hmm I even took a restroom break at end of F03. Next is cultivating, hopefully this now goes a bit faster than 11km/h like before.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Saved game and exited fs25, I need no error shizzle, gotta restart the game to clear memory of all issues. Also good time to take another restroom break before continuing, can stretch my legs a bit.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T07:30:45Z Booted fs25 back up, got into challenger mt665, hooked it up with bredal k105, getting to fertilizing mood, second layer coming up.

Fields are now ready for planting, but that is far away in next year, plenty of time accelerating to do. Drove challenger mt665 with bredal k105 to the dealership, diesel refueled the tractor, then repaired tractor and bredal for 3.3k and 1.8k, budget now 101.3k. Its amazing how quickly the repair maintenance builds up in fs25.
</p>

<p>
Then hooked tractor up with kverneland optimus rs planter, refilled the last seed pallet, purchased one big bag of seeds for 1.2k, then refilled planter. Drove tractor back to the farm yard and unfolded planter, its now ready to go for next year apr when soybeans planting season begins.
</p>

<p>
Hmm contracts, dunno man but somehow I have lost faith in the field sizes on this miniscule claustrophobic terrain, there is just no money to be made in these field sizes. Only thing worth doing is was it F24 which pays 12k or something like that, its good money, but when average fertilizing contract pays like 2k, yeah not very nice.
</p>

<p>
Checked giants developer network (GDN), still no giants editor v10 release, okay back to farming.
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0908hrs soybeans planting season begins now, aayeah.

</p>

<p>
Again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Parked planter into a shed, then hooked tractor with grain trailer, now just time accelerating until soybeans best market price in jun.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0924hrs loaded 32k liters of soybeans into grain trailer, then off to farmers market to sell this load which is all I got.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T09:22:02Z Sold 32k liters of soybeans at farmers market for 116k, budget now 215.6k.
</p>

<p>
Drove tractor back to the farm yard, saved game. Then more time accelerating. However at this point its my lunch break, even though my daily sleeping schedule is off the whack now so I'm not exactly sure whether I should eat or go to sleep, but I'm not tired so lunch break it is, I'm going to take my time with this one, heating the oven and all that. Time accelerating continues when I return.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T10:20:00Z Feeding time is over, now continues soybeans harvest season waiting.
</p>

<p>
Hmm now there is 11.5k reward baling contract for F38 (4.37ha), that might be interesting to do, its quite large field for a baling contract with one vehicle though, not overly large but definitely takes a while. But yeah I'm keeping my eye on soybeans harvest season.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0917hrs soybeans harvest season has begun, my crops are ready to harvest. Fire up the harvester, its go time.

Another soybeans harvest season is done! Whohoo <img src="../images/smileys/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Smiley :D" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Drove harvest fleet (heh) to the farm yard, dumped grain and parked vehicles, this season is over. Now restroom break while I contemplate what to do next in this savegame and the gaming session overall.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T12:00:00Z Oh wow that was perfect noon keystroke for tenth of a second precise hehe. Anyhow, yeah didn't come up with anykind of game-plan, I would love to get my hands on Giants Editor v10 right now, could start to learn about FS25 terrain engine changes and creating some PMC terrains, but hmm guess I'm good to go for further progression on this savegame as well. Not sure if another soybeans planting season is very interesting right now, did I already do... hmm whoah three(?) harvests on todays gaming session, lost count already. Unfortunately money is not enough to buy anything useful. Yeah I still have the bank loan option of course. Also I could buy silage bale wrapping equipment and do few years with my fields just grass, in my animal game-mode savegame I made some good money by selling silage. Hmm I got options.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T12:13:44Z Browsed giants forum a bit, a lot of new topics about FS25, most foreign language. No news on giants editor v10 yet. At this time I'm starting to yawn and eyes feel tired, been a long day of farming. Alarm for 17hrs been awake is still 2hrs 15min away, would be nice if I coul stay awake at least that time but dunno. It feels just overall that my day is over regarding farming, just feel too tired already to focus properly.
</p>

<p>
In fact I'm going to call it a night here, as usual there is nothing I could finish in-game with the time remaining that would top of what I have already achieved today, so better to call it a night here. I'm too tired to HTML web page edit as well, but perhaps I could try at least to start planning on putting some of these farming stories into web page format, been just playing instead of HTML editing since nov 12th heh. Anyways.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-15T12:18:49Z Saved game and exited fs25, more farming tomorrow, good night.
