	<h1>Mods Seed Tender - PMC Farming Simulator 25</h1>

<p>
Seed Tender mods for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25). Seed tender is a special trailer which is used to haul seeds and fertilizer to fields where seeder/planter is working on. Usually it has some specialized equipment like auger pipe to make seed/fertilizer dumping easier. There are small pickup truck pulled seed tenders and then large semi-truck pulled ones. You can use dump trucks as seed tenders to haul large loads of seed/fertilizer if your seeder has loading mechanism to get the product from the dump bed thing (sorry my terminology is lacking hah). Even something as Lode King Distinction Super-B is technically a seed tender as you can use it to refill big Bourgault air carts just like real life American and Canadian farmers do, however seed tender usually has specialized equipment to be called a "tender".
