Join discussion in <a href="https://www.pmctactical.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=80" target="_blank">PMC Tactical Forum FS25 General area</a>. Please read <a href="../17/guide.php">Farming Simulator 17 Guide</a>, <a href="../19/guide.php">Farming Simulator 19 (FS19) Guide</a> and <a href="../22/guide.php">Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) Guide</a> so you can get up to speed, its much of the same data.
</p>

<p>
FS25 is a clone of FS22 with few new gimmick features like ground deformation, if you know how to play FS19 and FS22 then you know pretty much everything there is to know about FS25 as well.
</p>

	<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>
Cattle, cows, chickens, pigs, sheep and bees. Animal action all the way. But how do I even begin to learn how to tend and take care of all these animals in FS25? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Smiley :o" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
No worries, PMC <a href="../22/guide-animals.php">FS22 Animals Guide root page</a> has all the info you need.
</p>


	<h2>Contracts</h2>

<p>
Contracts are for working on AI farmers fields either with borrowed or your own vehicles and equipment. For more details please read <a href="contracts.php">FS25 Contracts</a> page.
</p>


	<h2>Crops Best Selling Prices</h2>

<p>
For beginning players its always difficult to get good progress into your farm, to develop it further, buy better vehicles and more farmland, knowing the best crop selling prices is essential.
</p>

<p>
For more details please read <a href="../22/guide-crops-best-selling-price.php">FS22 Playing Guide Crops Best Selling Price</a>.
</p>


	<h2>Build Mode</h2>

<p>
Build mode is feature under which placeables, landscaping and all related items are listed. For more details please read <a href="../22/guide-build-mode.php">FS22 Playing Guide Build Mode</a>.
</p>


	<h2>Fertilizing</h2>

<p>
If you want full yield from the crops you seed/plant there must be 100% fertilization. You can fertilize using solid fertilizer spreader, liquid fertilizer sprayer, manure spreader or slurry spreader/distributor.
</p>

<p>
One nice way to get things done efficiently is to use multiple fertilizer sources, check <a href="../22/guide-fertilizing-manure-slurry.php">FS22 Fertilizing With Manure And Slurry</a> page for details.
</p>

	<h2>Production Chains</h2>

<p>
Production chains are good old factories, where you produce your own goods. There is a long history in FS17 and FS19 for generating fertilizer, seeds, etc along with more complex goods which can then be further used in other factories.
</p>

<p>
For more details please read <a href="../22/guide-production-chains.php">FS22 Playing Guide Production Chains</a>.
</p>


	<h2>Rock Picking</h2>

<p>
Back in FS19 ThundR created a mod for rock picking, now this is an in-game Farming Simulator 22 (FS22) and FS25 feature. Giants call this "stone picking" but all real life youtube farming videos use rock picking terminology.
</p>
