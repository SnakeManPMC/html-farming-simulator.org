New Farmer Riverbend Springs PMC Farming Simulator 25 (FS25) Stories. This story is about me playing FS25 at day one (or is it day zero heh) right at the game release day, first time game-play. You can follow me on a journey to grow my small New Farmer savegame into better vehicles, equipment and larger farmland area.

<p>
2024-11-18T04:47:07Z New farming day has started, today is technically monday early morning but for me its kind of still sunday, I think, not sure. Already woke up earlier in the sunday, stayed up for hours, but then went to take a nap or a full nights sleep not sure which was it was supposed to be, it only was like three hours or something so now I'm back here, it feels like a new day and wanted to farm some while waiting for Giants Editor v10 to be released, hopefully on tuesday.
</p>

<p>
This savegame now has 78hrs 0min on it.
</p>

<p>
Nice sounding number, zero <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Okay so FS25 is booted up, just ate days... err first meal, I guess, heh dunno, I'm good to go for a long farming session, hopefully it will be one of those <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Plan now is to return into grain crop farming, enough silage baling, I've had my share of grass mowing, baling, wrapping and collecting those bales, there will be time when I return to grass baling operation but it will be then more like fun than for the money I hope. Now I want to split up my crops, I want to do canola and soybeans so there is a slight rotation in the planting, harvest and best market price seasons, this should hopefully keep game-play interesting instead of that mundane repeat of the same year after year. In the very long term future, when I get more money, then I would like to bring in animals and production chains placeables into play, like really immersing myself into the full farming simulator (25) experience <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T05:58:31Z Spent a lot of time (it feels like at least) moving previous days OBS captured MP4 video clips to PMC DevSurf computer (robocopy /mov is still running) and downloading some mods, animal barns/sheds I might want to use down the road, extended capacities and all that good stuff. But now need to start focusing on farming instead of ALT-TABbing to do everything else <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Ugh there was 134gb of MP4 files since nov 12th gaming sessions, that takes a long time to move over local area network (LAN) even though its gigabit speed, once HDD becomes full then it slows down to relatively speaking crawling speed. I have to wait here before continuing playing fully as I cannot OBS video capture while previous clips are being moved away from the SSD, at least I don't trust my computer hardware/software to be able to do that much file handling operations at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Once this huge file moving operation is complete then I have to take another several moments to switch over to PMC DevSurf computer and kdenlive create video rendering project for these new MP4 clips, start to render that and only then I get to fully be back to fs25.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T06:18:01Z I made a decision now that all video clips have to be moved to editing computer after full days gaming session, then before the next gaming session begins those video clips have to be added into kdenlive video rendering project. Its just the only sane way to keep pushing forward, I cant get bogged down like this with massive 130+ gigabyte load of MP4's laying around, its just pure laziness and obsession to farm instead of taking care of mandatory computer chores.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T06:26:10Z Robocopy is done moving MP4 files over the LAN, now I'll switch over to quickly create kdenlive video projects...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T07:26:17Z Back. Now three 45 min tv show duration episodes are running, S01E01 through S01E03. I felt extremely uncomfortable while creating those kdenlive video editing/rendering projects as PMC Gaming computer was running "here" on the background with monitor turned on, I was pressed on time and I don't do such crap, I want to enjoy computer stuff, do it on my own time and schedule, when I want and how much I want, I really dislike running two computers at the same time burning through electricity, increasing my electric bill, but sometimes you have to do it. Now I feel extremely relaxed and good when PMC DevSurf CPU fan's are spinning up while several cores are hard at work rendering the first video.
</p>

<p>
Okay, NOW do I get to begin farming? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Smiley :rolleyes:" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Farming recap; oct in-game 1331hrs with budget 468.5k, I own the merged F05 (fields 3, 4 and 5) and F02.
</p>

<p>
What I've learned while playing farming simulator games in recent years is that "vehicles over land" when you're growing your farm. You must have proper equipment to work those fields efficiently and just fast, there is no point owning huge amount of hectares if you're running some puny 4m style equipment.
</p>

<p>
So my next step forward is to buy more and better equipment, I have to get a decent sprayer to bring that essential part of farming into play, now I could be a game-y by using some cultivator turned plow and simply plow in every planting season fert-plow-fert-seed and then I didn't need to herbicide spray. However its kind of fishy way to play, dunno. Also realistic plow is narrow and/or slow, or requires sick amount of horsepower from the tractor and I have no such money currently to buy both. Dunno maybe it would be best to purchase some tractor attached herbicide spraying equipment and continue shallow cultivating with kuhn prolander 7500.
</p>

<p>
Wrote down these below:
</p>

<pre>
- sprayer (tractor attached tank) hardi mega 1200l tank 5k
- sprayer (tractor attached) hardi mega 1200l 24m 12km/h 30.5k
</pre>

<p>
And already feel PTSD alike mood when even thinking about driving 12km/h speed spraying 24m width, I mean its not the end of the world equipment size/speed, but its truly sad to operate that crap tractor attached sprayer, I just die inside when I see tractor crawl 12km/h along the field hosting that sprayer system <img src="../images/smileys/icon_sad.gif" alt="Smiley :(" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Actually it feels like a really good plan getting some decent plow digger/ripper equipment and just do that every year, hmm hmm.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T07:53:54Z Cant decide again so going to pickup solid fertilizer for bredal k105 from the dealership and then put on a layer to my fields bringing it up to 100% hmm or actually wait, hmm it should give one layer of fertilization when I cultivate that grass in, okay going to do that instead.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T07:57:46Z Started cultivating F05, manually GPS.

<p>
After I had done half a headland I realized fertilizing stage will not change, this field work course does not give me extra layer of fertilizer, I should have just fertilized straight up. But I decided to run this kuhn prolander 7500 shallow cultivator into my fields now, to get a fresh start, then second layer of fertilizer and I'm good to go when planting season comes.
</p>

<p>
While running this shallow cultivator I was planning to research and write realistic american farming web page, for everyone to learn from and as reminder for myself like when returning from a long farmsim break that which cultivator/plow do I need to get etc.
</p>

<p>
Err whats going on here, NOW there is fertilizing layer 2 in place, huh why, why didn't it show it earlier when I checked PDA mapview? <img src="../images/smileys/icon_confused.gif" alt="Smiley :?" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
<i>Edit 2024-12-05T14:45:18Z, that is one of the many Farming Simulator 25 v1.2.1 and v1.3 bugs, sometimes, cant recall if it was the first time on game start or randomly, when you switch over to fertilizing PDA mapview, was it soil management tab or what was it called, it gets stuck in the "Loading map..." status, in situation like this you have to switch back to the other tabs and then back to this one and finally it loads up OK. So guess in my above example I was looking at the frozen screen stuck in loading and didn't notice (or actually knew about the bug at the time).</i>
</p>

<p>
Hah oh well whatever, this is great, no need to fertilize spread.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T08:25:31Z Started cultivating F02, manually GPS.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T08:41:15Z Finished cultivating F02.
</p>

<p>
My two fields are now ready for planting, soybeans is first then canola. Have not decided yet which way I go, most likely F05 soybeans as its bigger, I want them big dollarz from big yield <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
Feels good to have this field work done, however perhaps because I feel so good I want to "reward myself" (huh what am I, a dog??? haha) by eating some junk food and dessert event though my feeding time is still almost an hour away, I'll expedite it a bit, feeling quite hungry. So after that its time acceleration or perhaps check on the contracts board if there is anything worth for me to do. Anyways, lunch break ...
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T09:21:04Z Feeding time is over, back to growing my farm.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at contracts board, there was couple of nicely paying contracts but dunno if 5k or so is nice enough for me when I have nearly half a million in the bank. Hmm guess I'll stick with regular field work and now start to time accelerate until apr which is soybeans planting season.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0914hrs not much happening, nothing interesting in the dealership sales. Tomorrow in-game is soybeans planting season so going to take a quick restroom break and then continue time accelerating ready to attack planting season early in the morning (not that time would be an issue but yeah anyways).
</p>

<p>
Apr in-game 0651hrs okay soybeans planting season has arrived, time to break out the kverneland optima rs planter, refill with seeds and hit the fields.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T10:01:54Z Started planting soybeans F05, manually GPS.

<p>
2024-11-18T10:19:36Z Kverneland ran out of seeds, OK refill time, luckily have couple of pallets in my farm yard.
</p>

<a href="screenshots/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-18T1019.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="screenshots/thumbs/New-Farmer-Riverbend-Springs-2024-11-18T1019.jpg" class="terrainimg" loading="lazy" alt="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot" title="New Farmer Riverbend Springs Farming Simulator 25 Screenshot"></a>

<p>
2024-11-18T10:23:56Z Finished planting soybeans F05.
</p>

<p>
It is done, next up would be herbicide spraying but ain't got no equipment, so going to take the yield hit on weeds. So time acceleration commences until aug when canola planting season begins, I've alredy parked challenger mt665 with kverneland optima rs planter by F02 E side, ready to go as soon as seasonal conditions are right.
</p>

<p>
The dealership has elmers haulmaster for sale -59% off, that would be tempting to buy but for my current operation size its an overkill, there is zero need for such grain cart, not that I'd have tractor to pull it in the first place. But of course those good deals are always tempting.
</p>

<p>
Aug in-game 0909hrs its canola planting season, oh yeah.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T10:39:47Z Started planting canola F02, manually GPS.

<p>
2024-11-18T10:51:57Z Finished planting canola F02.
</p>

<p>
When I unfolded, unhooked planter and then tried to hook it up with tractor, I got an error:
</p>

<p>
Saved game and exited fs25, time for a restart.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T10:57:18Z FS25 booted up, challenger mt665 with planter parked away in a vehicle shed.
</p>

<p>
Oct in-game 0920hrs soybeans harvest season has begun, break out the combine harvester.

<p>
2024-11-18T11:58:38Z Finished harvesting soybeans F05.
</p>

<p>
Well that went by quickly, fifty or so minutes, one field, F05. This fields yield was 22.7k liters.
</p>

<p>
Now the next seasonal event is... soybeans planting season in apr, then in jul canola harvest season begins.
</p>

<p>
Hmm thinking about long term future here, well heh dunno if its long term but anyways, budget is 468.7k now with little fluctuating because nightly maintenance fees and property income from solar panels, hmm so I could possibly buy one or two farmlands but as I mentioned earlier vehicles over farmland, but with vehicles I am not sure what can I buy with that budget, its so little, just no way for a large combine + header, not that the current one would be too underpowered but still. Cultivating, well yeah those big boy cultivators require huge amount of horsepower so its a no go budget wise. Planter... well kinze 4905 would be the next one but again it would be a huge cost.
</p>

<p>
Its quite funny situation that half a million is JUST on the low end of budget that you cant buy anything powerful with it, well you could buy ONE tractor, but then you were broke basically.
</p>

<p>
Now of course there is the option of bank loan again, I could go all in with that, hmm but I managed to sneak my way through the previous loan so luckily that I'd hate to tempt my fate again <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T12:50:47Z I'm falling into indecision again, its kind of like you cant win if you don't play, no guts no glory, I should probably just max out the loan and then buy as many vehicles + little land I can, that would be the best boost for my farm growth opposed to this kind of safe approach where I don't live outside my budget boundaries. In fact I heard that you can max out a bank loan, buy farmland and then take even more loan against that newly owned farmland. Of course such approach would not really get you more vehicles if all your money focus goes to farmland and that leads into suffering with small vehicles. So anyways, going to time accelerate to soybeans planting season while contemplating what to do and monitoring the dealership sales daily.
</p>

<p>
Mar in-game 0916hrs one more day before soybeans planting season, guess I'm off to prepare the field, grabbing bredal k105, go get some solid fertilizer and then off to work.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 1k liters of diesel fuel to my farm yards placeable tank, it was like 1.6k. Then refueled challenger mt665 before hooking it up with bredal k105 spreader.
</p>

<p>
Purchased 8 big bags of solid fertilizer for 15.3k. Then refilled bredal k105 spreader.

<p>
Quick one. However next task is not so much, shallow cultivating. I mean kuhn prolander 7500 is nice compact little implement, but its no five minute task to get this field done. Oh well it wont get done if I moan about it here so better get at it <img src="../images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" alt="Smiley ;)" loading="lazy">

<p>
For this steering assist setup I used 3 headlands, I felt like the previous one with two was a bit too tight on the turns.
</p>

<p>
2024-11-18T13:53:01Z Alarm went off in the phone to eat but I'm not even hungry yet, well this is fs25 celebration two weeks with junk food and desserts so gotta get my grub on <img src="../images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smiley :)" loading="lazy">

<p>
Uah it took a while, but was still somewhat OK, I could use larger shallow cultivator soon, this kuhn prolander 7500 is running out of its "cuteness" real soon.

<p>
2024-11-18T15:28:49Z Starting to feel quite tired, eyes suddenly got very irritated, have to blink alot. And I just ate, this is such a waste if I have to call it a night soon with full belly, what a waste of food. But I'll do my best to farm as long as my eyes remain open heh.
</p>

<p>
Jun in-game 0913hrs switched over to challenger mt665, hooked it up with brantner grain trailer, loaded 22.7k of soybeans grain, then headed over to grain river silo selling point, lets make some money.
</p>

<p>
