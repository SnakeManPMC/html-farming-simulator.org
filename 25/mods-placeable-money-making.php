	<h1>Mods Placeable Money Making - PMC Farming Simulator 25</h1>

<p>
Placeable Money Making mods for Farming Simulator 25 (FS25). Cheating placeable buildings that just generate silly amounts of money for you without any work required. These are most commonly solar panels and wind turbines. If you use such mods you're a cheater, sorry to be blunt but that's how it is. You cannot compare solar panels and wind turbines into real life farming theme as the overall money system in farmsim games is so weird. You can just spam solar panels etc placeables, then time accelerate, get money monthly, then buy more of these placeables and time accelerate more for some more money, it makes no sense in regular farming "simulator" wise, its just cheating, might as well use dev console and "cheat money" the money in, would be just the same. So you have to make the decision that do you like to play with few solar panels or perhaps even wind turbins around your farm or not, just know what you are if that is how you choose to play. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to use these money making placeables if they were not so cheaty, but it is what it is, I have destroyed I think three different savegame because summy cheating with money making placeables, I've learned my lesson.
